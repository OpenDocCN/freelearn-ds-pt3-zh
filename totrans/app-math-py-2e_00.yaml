- en: Python is a powerful and flexible programming language that is fun and easy
    to learn. It is the programming language of choice for many professionals, hobbyists,
    and scientists. The power of Python comes from its large ecosystem of packages
    and a friendly community, and its ability to communicate seamlessly with compiled
    extension modules. This means that Python is ideal for solving problems of all
    kinds, especially mathematical problems.

- en: Mathematics is usually associated with calculations and equations but, in reality,
    these are very small parts of a much larger subject. At its core, mathematics
    is about solving problems, and the logically structured approach to solutions.
    Once you explore past the equations, calculations, derivatives, and integrals,
    you discover a vast world of beautiful, elegant structures.

- en: This book is an introduction to solving mathematical problems using Python.
    It introduces some of the basic concepts of mathematics and how to use Python
    to work with these concepts. It also introduces some basic templates for solving
    a variety of mathematical problems across a large number of topics within mathematics.
    The first few chapters focus on core skills such as working with NumPy arrays,
    plotting, calculus, and probability. These topics are very important throughout
    mathematics and act as a foundation for the rest of the book. In the remaining
    chapters, we discuss more practical problems, covering topics such as data analysis
    and statistics, networks, regression and forecasting, optimization, and game theory.
    We hope that this book provides a basis for solving mathematical problems and
    the tools for you to further explore the world of mathematics.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is primarily aimed at people who have some experience with Python
    and have projects (for work or just for fun) that involve solving some kind of
    mathematical problem. In the first few chapters we aim to give a small taste of
    the mathematical background for those who are not familiar with the basics, but
    we are rather limited by space. I’ve provided some suggestions for further reading
    at the end of each chapter to point you to resources where you can learn more.
    I hope that this book gets you started on your mathematical problems, and sparks
    your curiosity to learn more about the mathematics behind these subjects.

    least Python 3.6, but higher versions are preferable. (The code for this edition
    has been tested on Python 3.10, but should work on earlier versions too.) You
    might prefer to use the Anaconda distribution of Python, which comes with many
    of the packages and tools required in this book. If this is the case, you should
    use the `conda` package manager to install the packages. Python is supported on
    all major operating systems – Windows, macOS, and Linux – and on many platforms.
