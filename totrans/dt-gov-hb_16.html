			<h1 id="_idParaDest-330"><a id="_idTextAnchor329"/>Delivering Trusted Results with Outcomes That Matter</h1>
			<p>As the implementation of data governance occurs, the chief data and analytics officer and their leadership team must keep all messaging on delivering trusted results that are framed in business outcomes. This mindset requires CDAOs and their teams to think beyond “data metrics” into outcomes that matter to the business. In this chapter, you will learn how to ensure consistency in what was promised to stakeholders versus what was actually delivered, how to explain variances in expected delivery versus real results, and why that is trust building. Last, you will learn how to message back to stakeholders powerfully during delivery <span class="No-Break">for impact.</span></p>
			<p>As we dig in, I want to reframe much of what we have covered in this book to bring us to a final view, and that is to pull together a standard end-to-end data governance approach. As we have covered over the last 15 chapters, you will have to customize this model to meet your individual needs. I also want to highlight that this model is not unique. Over the last 10-plus years, I have seen variations of this model produced by endless consultants in every firm I’ve interacted with. Thus, this is my twist on a model that I have seen over and <span class="No-Break">over again.</span></p>
			<p>Part of building trust is setting expectations, delivering what you say you will, adjusting where needed, and staying focused on making an impact that can be measured. All along this journey, message clearly what you must do to set up capabilities that may or may not be “felt” or measurable to the business, and also what is directly impacting the business that they can feel and we can measure. Don’t be afraid to state when something is foundational that will serve another capability. This delineation and clarity <span class="No-Break">is critical.</span></p>
			<p>This chapter covers the <span class="No-Break">following topics:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>How to <span class="No-Break">message stakeholders</span></li>
				<li>How to communicate unexpected results and variances <span class="No-Break">from commitments</span></li>
				<li>How to deliver results to <span class="No-Break">build trust</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Capability review</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-331"><a id="_idTextAnchor330"/>How to message stakeholders</h1>
			<p>When messaging stakeholders about new data solutions for impact, it’s crucial to tailor your approach to their interests and <a id="_idIndexMarker931"/>concerns. Remember that any variance from what their perception is (not necessarily what you told them, but what they expect) is a cause for questions. The burden lies with you to support their understanding with credible facts regarding your teams’ impact. It’s important to deliver trusted results with the stakeholders in mind. Let’s recap a few key components of how to <span class="No-Break">frame messaging.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Example of low-impact messaging</p>
			<p class="callout">When launching a new team, take the<a id="_idIndexMarker932"/> time to customize messaging, especially if meeting one-on-one <span class="No-Break">with stakeholders.</span></p>
			<p class="callout">One of the worst examples of messaging with stakeholders I have been a part of was meeting individually with top leaders but with overly generic materials. When you take time to meet individually but use generic materials, it does not take advantage of the incredible opportunity you have as a leader to showcase exactly, and with specificity, what you and your team do for the stakeholder group. By using generic materials, you miss out on a much more enriched conversation about the stakeholders’ specific benefits received from <span class="No-Break">your team.</span></p>
			<p class="callout">If you are presenting in a large forum with stakeholders, it can still be disheartening to be generic. Use specific use cases to demonstrate how your team is adding value to stakeholders, and, better yet, have the stakeholders present those examples for even more <span class="No-Break">high-impact communication.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-332"><a id="_idTextAnchor331"/>Focus on value and impact</h2>
			<p>Put communications in <a id="_idIndexMarker933"/>terms of value and impact. Be sure to use the <em class="italic">value measurement methodology</em> we defined in <a href="B18846_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor110"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></span></a>. Use business impact to frame the calculated impact for even more powerful, <span class="No-Break">trusted results:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Start with the “why”</strong>: Clearly articulate the problem the solution addresses and how it directly impacts their specific goals or concerns. Use quantifiable metrics and real-world examples to demonstrate the <span class="No-Break">potential benefits.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Align with their priorities</strong>: Frame the solution in the context of existing initiatives and pain points. Show how it aligns with their strategic objectives and addresses key challenges <span class="No-Break">they face.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Emphasize impact over features</strong>: As we covered in detail in <a href="B18846_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor110"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></span></a>, focus on the tangible <a id="_idIndexMarker934"/>outcomes the solution will deliver, not just its technical features. Show how it will lead to improved decision-making, stronger processes, or better financial performance. The business doesn’t care what feature you release. They care about what they can do now that they couldn’t do before, now that <span class="No-Break">it’s available.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-333"><a id="_idTextAnchor332"/>Speak their language</h2>
			<p>You must use language that is common<a id="_idIndexMarker935"/> to the business, not common to data professionals. Huge frustration for most data professionals who struggle to get business buy-in is the lack of “data understanding” or “data literacy” the <span class="No-Break">business has:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Avoid technical jargon</strong>: Use clear, concise language that resonates with your audience. Explain complex concepts in layman’s terms and focus on the practical implications. This is one of the biggest mistakes I see data professionals make. They get frustrated when the business “doesn’t get it” or “isn’t data literate.” It is your job to make the data capabilities translate into language that speaks to the business. Not the other <span class="No-Break">way around.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Tailor your message to each stakeholder group</strong>: Understand their priorities and communication preferences. It may seem like a lot of extra work to tailor it in this way, but so is delivering a great solution that no one understands and, therefore, <span class="No-Break">doesn’t use.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Use visuals, analogies, or case studies relevant to their interests</strong>: Highlight ease of use and accessibility. Demonstrate how the solution will be intuitive and accessible<a id="_idIndexMarker936"/> to their teams, regardless of their <span class="No-Break">technical expertise.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-334"><a id="_idTextAnchor333"/>Address concerns and build trust</h2>
			<p>As you meet and build relationships with your stakeholders, it is important to remember you are there to serve the company’s needs. This means it is your job to listen deeply to what challenges exist and work with <a id="_idIndexMarker937"/>your stakeholders to provide solutions that optimally deliver results with impact. By starting from a posture of service, you<a id="_idIndexMarker938"/> will build trust with your stakeholders each time you deliver a solution that supports their needs. As you work to address their concerns and build trust, remember to do <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Listen to understand</strong>: Do not listen to respond; listen to hear your stakeholders, and then address their concerns. This isn’t a debate. You provide a service to them. Listen to their concerns and address the feedback in whole to <span class="No-Break">build trust.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Acknowledge potential challenges</strong>: Anticipate their concerns about data privacy, security, job displacement, or ethical implications. Address them proactively <span class="No-Break">and transparently.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Explain data governance and security measures</strong>: Demonstrate your commitment to responsible data use and robust security practices. Emphasize compliance with relevant regulations. Be clear about what data governance does to enable other capabilities and why these fundamentals power more advanced data capabilities to deliver <span class="No-Break">business outcomes.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Provide opportunities for feedback and participation</strong>: Involve stakeholders in the planning and implementation process. Address their concerns and incorporate their feedback to build trust <span class="No-Break">and ownership.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-335"><a id="_idTextAnchor334"/>Use clear and compelling communication</h2>
			<p>The best way to grab stakeholder attention is to be very specific and refined in what you say and show. Nothing loses the attention of stakeholders faster than too many non-specific words. Put yourself in<a id="_idIndexMarker939"/> their shoes, and write messaging like you would want to hear it. A few key ways to grab their attention include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Keep it concise and engaging</strong>: Capture their attention with a strong opening and present key points in a clear, structured way. Avoid <span class="No-Break">information overload.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Use storytelling and data visualization</strong>: Incorporate anecdotes, case studies, and data visualizations to make the message more impactful and memorable. Show the result; don’t <span class="No-Break">just tell.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Offer next steps and resources</strong>: Be clear about how stakeholders can learn more, get involved, or <span class="No-Break">provide feedback.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Remember – you are responsible for being the champion of the solution. Be passionate and enthusiastic about the data solution and its potential impact. This will inspire confidence and encourage adoption. It’s a good idea to start small and build momentum. Focus on a pilot project or quick win to demonstrate the solution’s value and gain initial buy-in. Measure and communicate success in bite-sized chunks. Track the impact of the data solution and share positive results with stakeholders to reinforce its value and encourage ongoing support. By following these principles and tailoring your message to your specific audience, you can effectively communicate the value of new data solutions and drive stakeholder adoption for <span class="No-Break">lasting impact.</span></p>
			<p>Now that we’ve covered the basics around communicating effectively, we will pivot to a more difficult communication pattern: how to communicate when things do <em class="italic">not</em> go <span class="No-Break">as planned.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-336"><a id="_idTextAnchor335"/>How to communicate unexpected results and variances from commitments</h1>
			<p>Communicating unexpected results and variances from commitments in data solutions requires transparency, proactiveness, and a<a id="_idIndexMarker940"/> focus on solutions. Here’s how to navigate this <span class="No-Break">situation effectively:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Be proactive and timely</strong>: Don’t wait until deadlines or meetings to disclose the issue. Inform stakeholders as soon as you identify deviations from commitments or <span class="No-Break">unexpected results.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Schedule a timely communication session</strong>: Depending on the severity of the variance, organize a dedicated meeting or briefing to address the <span class="No-Break">issue directly.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-337"><a id="_idTextAnchor336"/>Offer clarity and context</h2>
			<p>Don’t be afraid to refine and<a id="_idIndexMarker941"/> clarify what happened. Be specific, and don’t beat around the bush. Get right into what happened, why it happened, what the impact is, and what you’ll do about it. Start by doing <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Clearly explain the nature of the unexpected results or variances</strong>: Provide concise summaries and avoid <span class="No-Break">technical jargon.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Quantify the impact</strong>: Express the deviations in measurable terms, such as percentages or numbers, to convey the actual significance. Leverage the model from <a href="B18846_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor110"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></span></a> to articulate just how impactful the variance is, and establish a new measure for <span class="No-Break">the future.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Contextualize the situation</strong>: Explain the root cause of the variances, whether it’s due to data issues, technical limitations, or <span class="No-Break">external factors.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-338"><a id="_idTextAnchor337"/>Focus on solutions and next steps</h2>
			<p>It’s not enough to offer clarity and context. You must also steer the conversation forward. How will you solve<a id="_idIndexMarker942"/> this unexpected outcome? What will you do to help achieve the goals at hand? It’s important to explain and understand the impact but focus on moving forward. Quickly, but directly, focus forward. Ensure you include crisp communication by doing <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Don’t just dwell on the problem</strong>: Offer concrete solutions or mitigation strategies to address <span class="No-Break">the deviations.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Outline a realistic action plan</strong>: Describe the steps you’ll take to rectify the situation and get back on track. Include timelines and <span class="No-Break">responsible individuals.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Be transparent about potential future adjustments</strong>: If necessary, communicate potential adjustments to commitments or expectations based on the <span class="No-Break">new information.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-339"><a id="_idTextAnchor338"/>Maintain transparency and open communication</h2>
			<p>Being transparent when <a id="_idIndexMarker943"/>expected is one thing, but maintaining open dialogue and communication patterns is optimal. There are a few things you can do to keep open, trustworthy communication going between key meetings <span class="No-Break">and forums:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Actively listen to stakeholder concerns and answer their questions openly and honestly. Acknowledge their frustrations and address <span class="No-Break">any anxieties.</span></li>
				<li>Maintain open communication channels. Encourage stakeholders to reach out with further questions or concerns throughout <span class="No-Break">the process.</span></li>
				<li>Provide regular updates. Share progress on the implemented solutions and keep stakeholders informed <span class="No-Break">about developments.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Tailor your communication to the audience. Adapt your messaging style and level of detail based on the stakeholders’ specific needs and roles. You will build rapport by focusing on positive framing. While acknowledging the deviations, emphasize your commitment to resolving the issue and achieving positive outcomes. This will keep both your team and your stakeholders moving forward, together. Learn from the experience, as a team. Reflect on the root cause of unexpected results and implement measures to prevent similar occurrences<a id="_idIndexMarker944"/> in <span class="No-Break">the future.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Failure builds trust</p>
			<p class="callout">One of the best ways I’ve found to build trust is to be open and vulnerable when things do not go well. In transformational programs, when things start to slip or don’t go as planned, it is typical for leaders to work to make things green or paint a picture that is optimized for steering committees or other forums where reporting <span class="No-Break">is communicated.</span></p>
			<p class="callout">In my experience, the opposite is often much more effective in building trust. If you are open and transparent with leadership when you are in a yellow or red status and are not fearful of putting your body of work in these statuses, they tend to believe your reporting and delivery as effective, more so than a team that is continuously <span class="No-Break">in green.</span></p>
			<p class="callout">In fact, one company I worked for had an executive who stated, “If we aren’t in yellow or red periodically, we might not be pushing our teams <span class="No-Break">hard enough.”</span></p>
			<p>By following these steps, you can effectively communicate unexpected results and variances in data solutions while maintaining stakeholder trust and fostering a collaborative approach to finding solutions. Remember – clear, proactive, and solution-oriented communication is key to building trust and navigating data <span class="No-Break">challenges constructively.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-340"><a id="_idTextAnchor339"/>How to deliver results to build trust</h1>
			<p>Building trust in data solutions goes beyond just the data itself. It’s about establishing a foundation of reliability, transparency, and <a id="_idIndexMarker945"/>accountability across the entire process. The most trusted solutions I have delivered in my career started with strong transparency, my willingness to take full and unwavering accountability, and delivering against commitments, thus establishing myself and my team as <span class="No-Break">reliable partners.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-341"><a id="_idTextAnchor340"/>Prioritize collaboration and communication</h2>
			<p>When you are working with stakeholders, bring them into the build process. It can be unusual but effective to bring stakeholders into iterative design processes versus waiting until you have a fully baked<a id="_idIndexMarker946"/> solution to show them the outcome. Being open about interim steps can help them see a few things: 1) the complexity of the solution and 2) when something isn’t going to serve them early so that quick pivots can be made. A few considerations to enable collaboration and communication include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Involve stakeholders throughout the process</strong>: Engage data users, business owners, and IT teams in planning, development, and implementation. Understand their needs <span class="No-Break">and concerns.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Communicate proactively and regularly</strong>: Share updates, address concerns, and gather feedback throughout the solution life cycle. Be transparent about challenges <span class="No-Break">and successes.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Establish clear governance and expectations</strong>: Define roles and responsibilities, data usage policies, and escalation procedures for addressing <span class="No-Break">data-related issues.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-342"><a id="_idTextAnchor341"/>Demonstrate expertise and competence</h2>
			<p>Another key component to building trust is ensuring your team is appropriately trained for the work they are completing. One of the most damaging risks to your team is to build a reputation of “incompetence.” If the company does not believe you have the credibility to deliver, you will have <a id="_idIndexMarker947"/>a hard time building trust. To build a team that is trusted, start by demonstrating competence and expertise by doing <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Build a team of skilled data professionals</strong>: Invest in developing the expertise of your data team to ensure they can handle complex data challenges and implement <span class="No-Break">solutions effectively</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Stay up to date with industry best practices</strong>: Continuously learn and adapt your approach based on evolving data standards, regulations, <span class="No-Break">and technologies</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Share successes and learnings</strong>: Showcase positive outcomes achieved through data solutions to<a id="_idIndexMarker948"/> build trust and encourage <span class="No-Break">further adoption</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-343"><a id="_idTextAnchor342"/>Foster a culture of openness and accountability</h2>
			<p>Creating a culture of psychological safety <a id="_idIndexMarker949"/>starts with you. You have to create a culture where openness and accountability are the normal way in which business is conducted. This means holding your team accountable for results but doing so in a way that allows people to make mistakes without fear of retribution. If you set expectations for results, you need to hold your team accountable for the results. A great way to model this is by stating something like, “I see we didn’t hit our goal here. What can we do to help?” This acknowledges the expected results were not met, but also indicates that you are in the problem with your team. This is critical because nothing demotivates a team more than when poor results are <span class="No-Break">not addressed.</span></p>
			<p>Have the courage to state clearly when results are not as expected, and be brave enough to hold team members accountable to deliver. Be human about it. You can do this with empathy and care while still holding your team accountable to deliver the results expected. A few ways to ensure a culture of openness and accountability is created are <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Encourage a culture of data-driven decision-making</strong>: Promote the use of data to inform strategy and actions, empowering stakeholders <span class="No-Break">with insights.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Embrace mistakes and learning opportunities</strong>: Encourage open communication about errors and near misses, learning from them to improve <span class="No-Break">future solutions.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Be accountable for results</strong>: Track the impact of your data solutions and measure progress toward agreed-upon goals. Share results and address <span class="No-Break">any gaps.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Building trust takes time and effort. It’s an ongoing process that requires a consistent commitment to these principles. You will need to tailor your approach based on your specific context and audience. What works for one organization may not be suitable for another. Continuously evaluate and refine your approach. Seek feedback from stakeholders and adapt your strategies based on their needs <span class="No-Break">and perceptions.</span></p>
			<p>By focusing on these principles, you can develop trust in your data solutions and create an environment where data is used effectively to drive positive outcomes for all stakeholders. The core tenet of building trusted results all comes down to the principles described previously. You bring a <a id="_idIndexMarker950"/>critical skill to the table: excellence in data governance. You are in your role because the company has entrusted you to deliver great results with impact. Don’t forget that. You are in that role for a reason. Lean into the lessons in this book. Deliver with transparency, be willing to fail, but most of all, build trust in everything <span class="No-Break">you do.</span></p>
			<p>Before we transition to the final chapter of this book, which is a case study of a fictitious company and how I would suggest a data leader handle that scenario, I want to recap how all the capabilities we went through in this book come together. It’s a difficult task to weave all of the powerful data governance solutions together into a view that transcends industries, but I want to leave you with a strong summary as you digest the contents and context of this book, before heading into the case study in <a href="B18846_17.xhtml#_idTextAnchor351"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 17</em></span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-344"><a id="_idTextAnchor343"/>Capability review</h1>
			<p>Let’s review each of these capabilities <a id="_idIndexMarker951"/>one by one, to show how to deliver trusted results with outcomes that matter for the business. This section is meant to be a <span class="No-Break">reference guide.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-345"><a id="_idTextAnchor344"/>Data governance</h2>
			<p>Data governance is a practice that <a id="_idIndexMarker952"/>ensures an organization has trustworthy information. Data governance typically includes policies, standards, processes, tools, and people to enable effectively. Data governance helps organizations make better decisions, reduces risks, and improves <span class="No-Break">operational efficiency.</span></p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-350"><a id="_idTextAnchor349"/>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>This chapter concludes the core content of the book. After over 300 pages of content, it’s now up to you and your teams to activate the lessons in this book into outcomes for your company. There are so many evolving capabilities and new applications of old, which means this book will one day become out of date. I find that exciting! After working as a practitioner and passionate advocate for data governance for over a decade, I know there is so much more that can be done to optimize data governance capabilities. With improvements and innovation occurring every day, I have so much hope for the future of <span class="No-Break">this discipline.</span></p>
			<p>Companies need great data to deliver great results. They need practitioners like you and me to help them get there. If you take nothing away from the contents of this book than to be a humble partner for your business stakeholders, not working in parallel, but in the trenches of delivering great results with them, together, then that’s good enough for me. Data governance serves the company. As a data governance leader, that means you serve your stakeholders. Never lose sight of that. By striving to support the company, support great outcomes, and do so in a simple, straightforward manner, you will deliver trust in data. In the very last chapter, we will take all of the lessons from the book and apply them to a case study for a regulated entity: <span class="No-Break">a bank.</span></p>
