    dashboards for consumption on a screen. Often, you will expect users to interact
    with your dashboards and visualizations. However, there are good options for presenting,
    printing, and exporting in a variety of formats.

    Tableau Desktop, select **File** | **Export as PowerPoint...**. After selecting
    a location and filename, Tableau will generate a PowerPoint file (`.pptx`), converting
    each tab in the Tableau workbook to a single slide in PowerPoint. Each slide will
    contain a static image of the views and dashboards as they exist at the time of
    the export. As each slide is simply a screenshot, there will be no dynamic interactivity
    following the export.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you prefer a more dynamic presentation experience, consider using **Presentation
    mode**. This mode shows you all dashboards and views in full screen mode. It hides
    all toolbars, panes, and authoring objects. To activate presentation mode, select
    **Window** from the top menu or press *F7* or the option on the top toolbar. Press
    *F7* or the *Esc* key to exit presentation mode. While in presentation mode, you
    may still interact with dashboards and views using actions, highlighting, filtering,
    and other options. This enriches the presentation and gives you the ability to
    answer questions on the fly. When used with compelling dashboards and stories,
    presentation mode makes for an effective way to personally walk your audience
    through the data story.

    but there are a few things to consider.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the major considerations is whether you will be sharing a packaged workbook
    (`.twbx`) or an unpackaged workbook (`.twb`). Packaged workbooks are single files
    that contain the workbook (`.twb`), extracts (`.hyper`), file-based data sources
    that have not been extracted (`.xls`, `.xlsx`, `.txt`, `.cub`, `.mdb`, and others),
    custom images, and various other related files.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of Tableau Desktop.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Workbook files will be updated when saved in a newer version of Tableau Desktop.
    You may receive errors or warnings when you open the workbook in an older version
    of Tableau. You will be prompted about updates when you first open the workbook
    and again when you attempt to save it. You may optionally export a workbook as
    a previous version from the **File** menu.
  prefs:
  - PREF_IND
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you share an unpackaged (`.twb`) workbook, then anyone else using it must
    be able to access any data sources, and any referenced images must be available
    to the user in the same directory where the original files were referenced. For
    example, if the workbook uses a live connection to an Excel (`.xlsx`) file on
    a network path and includes images on a dashboard located in `C:\Images`, then
    all users must be able to access the Excel file on the network path and have a
    local `C:\Images` directory with image files of the same name.

- en: Tableau is an amazing platform for exploring, prepping, and cleaning your data
    as you create useful and meaningful visualizations and dashboards to understand
    and communicate key insights. Throughout this book, we've considered how to connect
    to data—whether file-based, in an on-premises database, or in the cloud. You've
    worked through examples of exploring and prepping data to clean it and structure
    it for analysis. We've covered numerous types of visualization and how they can
    uncover deep analytical insights. The four main types of calculations were explored
    in depth, giving you the tools to extend the data, analysis, and user interactivity.
    You've built dashboards and told stories with the data. In this chapter, we considered
    how to share the results of all your work with others.

    and easy to use. As you dive deeper, the simplicity becomes increasingly beautiful.
    As you discover new ways to understand your data, solve complex problems, ask
    new questions, and find new answers in your datasets, your new Tableau skills
    will help you uncover, interpret, and share new insights hidden in your data.
