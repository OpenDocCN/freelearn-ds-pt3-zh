    <h1 class="chapterTitle" id="_idParaDest-135">Streamlit Power Users</h1>
    <p class="normal">Welcome to the final chapter of this book! In this chapter, we will learn from the best – Streamlit creators with experience creating dozens of apps and Components, Streamlit power users turned Streamlit employees, and even the founder of the Streamlit library who now runs the company from within Snowflake. I sat down and interviewed six different users and learned about their backgrounds, their experience with Streamlit, and what tips they have for users of all experience levels. From these interviews, we will learn how they use Streamlit on a day-to-day basis at work, for teaching, and also about where Streamlit is going from here.</p>
    <p class="normal">This chapter is grouped into five interviews:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bulletList">Fanilo Andrianasolo, Streamlit creator and tech lead at Worldline</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Adrien Treuille, the Streamlit founder and CEO</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Gerard Bentley, a Streamlit creator and software engineer</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Arnaud Miribel and Zachary Blackwood, Streamlit data team members</li>
      <li class="bulletList">Yuichiro Tachibana, the creator of stlite and a Streamlit creator</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">First, let’s start with Fanilo!</p>
    <h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-136">Fanilo Andrianasolo</h1>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tyler</strong>: Hey, Fanilo! I <a id="_idIndexMarker440"/>just wanted to go ahead and get started; do you want to introduce yourself to everyone? What is your background? What do you spend your time working on these days?</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Fanilo</strong>: Hey everyone, my name is Fanilo. I’ve been working at WorldLine for the past 10 years, first as a big data engineer then going into business development, then into product management, and then back to managing data science teams. And now I work as more of a developer advocate, for data science and business intelligence internally and externally. </p>
    <p class="normal">It’s mostly talking to internal teams about how they can leverage data analytics in their payment products and then doing talks externally to promote our data analysis and data science skills.</p>
    <p class="normal">And then on the side, I’m also a lecturer at a university. I give lectures about big data and SQL. I do demonstrations using Streamlit for lectures.</p>
    <p class="normal">Finally, I also do a bit of content creation, mostly on YouTube (<a href="mailto:https://www.youtube.com/@andfanilo/videos"><span class="url">https://www.youtube.com/@andfanilo/videos</span></a>) and Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/andfanilo"><span class="url">https://twitter.com/andfanilo</span></a>), as well as talking externally.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tyler</strong>: That’s so many things! I mean, you’ve also been a part of this Streamlit community for a very long time now. You’re one of the first original interviews in the first edition of the book, you’ve been a regular contributor to the Streamlit forums, and now you’re a massive YouTuber in the space.</p>
    <p class="normal">What are the big changes in Streamlit, both as a company and as an open-source library?</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Fanilo</strong>: I just realized it has been 3 years of building Streamlit apps! When I started using Streamlit, it was a team of 9 people and there was a very small community. Now it has really exploded; there are so many social media posts it’s really hard to track everything down.</p>
    <p class="normal">I feel even with the tremendous state and popularity, it is still very approachable for new people or people that are not developers, as a way to create data apps.</p>
    <p class="normal">Streamlit has always been very careful to make it easy to use, but also to enable developers to build more advanced applications as well, while managing to listen to a huge community.</p>
    <p class="normal">One change is that<a id="_idIndexMarker441"/> they have loosened up on the constraints a little bit, for example, we couldn’t do styling in Markdown 2 years ago but now we can.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tyler</strong>: That’s awesome. So, what is your content diet when it comes to Streamlit like? If I’m trying to get into this space and know what’s happening and what people are building, is Twitter really the best place for discovery?</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Fanilo</strong>: I actually prefer to use the weekly roundup on the<a id="_idIndexMarker442"/> Streamlit Forums (<a href="https://discuss.streamlit.io/"><span class="url">https://discuss.streamlit.io/</span></a>), managed by Jessica. I don’t know how she pulls it all together, but it’s been one of my most reliable ways of staying inspired by Streamlit apps.</p>
    <p class="normal">I also get to see some apps in<a id="_idIndexMarker443"/> Hugging Face Spaces (<a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces"><span class="url">https://huggingface.co/spaces</span></a>). I regularly see strong apps there, and generally, both those sources go on Twitter or YouTube, so by the time I see it there, it is a repeat.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tyler</strong>: Speaking of an information diet, do you have any favorite apps that either you’ve created or seen recently?</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Fanilo</strong>: I’ve talked to multiple people who wanted to share their own apps with me. For example, there was a marketing guy who was starting out with Python and he wanted to start a small Python application that would create invoices to send to clients. And he made it so that his colleagues could go on the app and generate invoices as well, so it’s more of those small apps that everybody can build.</p>
    <p class="normal">I know of another use case where a user built his own startup around a Streamlit multi-page app that he provides to some medical facilities to allow them to track their medicine stock between buildings.</p>
    <p class="normal">It’s been very interesting to see those people create apps, even if it wasn’t a part of their initial job as a developer, or even if they weren’t developers. I think that those are the apps that stick with me the most.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tyler</strong>: I definitely get<a id="_idIndexMarker444"/> that; you really have a ton of interesting folks who come and talk to you about Streamlit or about their problems. With that context, what are some of the hardest parts of building Streamlit apps? Where do you see new builders going in the wrong direction?</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Fanilo</strong>: I often see a lot of people try to build a real-time application, which is possible but very hard to handle because suddenly they’re generating new Python threads or threads are conflicting with the main thread. Manipulating all of those is a hassle.</p>
    <p class="normal">I also see people who want to integrate Streamlit with their own design pattern at their company with all the visual customizations or putting all their data into a cache or session state. Those design patterns are not easy for beginner developers to integrate into Streamlit apps.</p>
    <p class="normal">I also see people that are trying to build very big applications and it can get pretty messy very fast because it’s hard for them to understand how the caching works with the rerunning of the app from top to bottom.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tyler</strong>: What do you mean by a bigger app? Like a really large multi-page app, or a really long app?</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Fanilo</strong>: Both, but mostly I’ve seen people that want to do, for example, cross-filtering between 40 different graphs on the same page. Maybe that’s a bit too much on one page and you should consider splitting that up into multiple apps, so an app has a single responsibility, and it can be very good to that end. That would maybe be better than stuffing everything onto one page.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tyler</strong>: On the flip side of that, I mentioned that you’ve seen a ton of folks learning about Streamlit, and you have some really nice tutorials on your YouTube channel. I think your most popular video at the moment is the epic Streamlit tutorial video (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIQQR_yq-8I"><span class="url">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIQQR_yq-8I</span></a>). How do I go from watching your great video content to building cool apps?</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Fanilo</strong>: I think doing something a hundred times is the best way to become a master of it. The way I do it is I kind of make a Streamlit app for almost any random idea I have in my life. For example, I recently made an app to track when I’m starting in a badminton tournament. I made another app to just query a MongoDB database. I made another app to query my Outlook mailbox to check the recently attached files and see if I need to download them.</p>
    <p class="normal">So, every time I’ve got an<a id="_idIndexMarker445"/> idea, I make an app, and the more I create apps, the more I get used to the Streamlit life cycle. I understand it’s about the creative expressiveness of Streamlit, where I can have an idea, make a draft, and iterate on it little by little. I feel like this is the best way to learn.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tyler</strong>: I feel both entertained and inspired whenever I watch you, and I’m sure other folks feel very similarly. Speaking of YouTube, what are your favorite YouTube videos that you’ve made about Streamlit? </p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Fanilo</strong>: When you start on YouTube, you realize that you have no clue what people will actually like. My own favorite videos are the ones that are performing the worst, and my least favorite videos are the ones that are performing the best.</p>
    <p class="normal">My favorite one would be the video on creating Components because talking to Python developers about JavaScript and React can prove quite tricky, to be honest. I was a little bit proud of the way I edited that video, and it reminded me of how far I had come with tutorials.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tyler</strong>: Do you have any advice for those folks who are interested in becoming Streamlit content creators or educators? I know you posted a video about this recently, so I’ll link it here (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT6lNKtGyP8&amp;t=163s"><span class="url">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT6lNKtGyP8&amp;t=163s</span></a>). But I wanted to give you a chance to mention some stuff as well.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Fanilo</strong>: Well, first, I can only encourage you to just do it because it has led me to so many opportunities, and to meet so many great people that wanted to share the apps with me, which I would not have had if I stayed only on Twitter, or only on the forum answering questions. So, that has been a huge benefit for me, and even in my own company.</p>
    <p class="normal">The unfortunate truth about starting content creation is the one that everybody shares. Every content creator will say this. There’s always this fear that maybe people won’t like you, or that people will judge you. I’m having those same conversations about the fact that people will judge me. What if I make a mistake? Or if people make fun of me?</p>
    <p class="normal">Most of the advice I give is to always think about starting small and with small, consistent steps because that’s how you create something, by working slowly. And also don’t compare the current present or your current journey to creators that have done this for 5 years because there’s nothing comparable, and that’s, like, the quickest way to burn out.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tyler</strong>: I think that’s great advice. It’s the same with careers as well, where you want to make sure that you don’t compare your first year with someone else’s tenth year.</p>
    <p class="normal">Well, this has been awesome, I just wanted to say thank you again for being interviewed twice! Before we go, do you have anything else you want to mention or talk about?</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Fanilo</strong>: I’m pretty easy to find online, so check out my YouTube channel – everything else is under my handle <code class="inlineCode">andfanilo</code>.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tyler</strong>: Fanilo can be found<a id="_idIndexMarker446"/> on GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/andfanilo"><span class="url">https://github.com/andfanilo</span></a>), YouTube (<a href="mailto:https://www.youtube.com/@andfanilo"><span class="url">https://www.youtube.com/@andfanilo</span></a>), and Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/andfanilo"><span class="url">https://twitter.com/andfanilo</span></a>).</p>
    <h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-137">Adrien Treuille</h1>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tyler</strong>: Hey, Adrien! Good to<a id="_idIndexMarker447"/> chat with you again; thanks for agreeing to be interviewed. Do you want to start this off with a quick intro?</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Adrien</strong>: Yeah! I was the founder and CEO of Streamlit for four and a half, maybe five years and then I became the head of Streamlit inside of Snowflake after the acquisition.</p>
    <p class="normal">Here we have two main goals, one of which is to build an amazing first-party version of Streamlit into Snowflake, affecting the entire Snowflake product line, and the other is to maintain and run this wonderful open-source project that is growing really quickly and is used all over the world by the world’s biggest companies.</p>
    <p class="normal">The move from being an independent company to Snowflake has really supercharged and added many dimensions to my job description, which is super exciting.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tyler</strong>: Great, I guess we can jump right in and talk about the acquisition first. That’s the biggest change from our first interview when the first version of this book came out. As you mentioned, in the spring of 2022, Streamlit was acquired by Snowflake. What was that process like? </p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Adrien</strong>: Streamlit was an <a id="_idIndexMarker448"/>unusual company in that it was first a personal project, and even when it became a business, it was as much a community and an open-source project as it was a business. Obviously, we thought there would be long-term success with the business model, but we always were a very mission-driven organization in that we genuinely believed that this product we were bringing to the world would advance the state of the art and would make people’s lives better.</p>
    <p class="normal">As a part of that, we never once looked at Streamlit and asked why we were doing this, or how we would squeeze as much money out of it as possible. We created a vehicle that enables us to get the product in as many hands as possible and continue to work on it with talented designers, engineers, and data scientists to the benefit of everyone.</p>
    <p class="normal">Then, when Snowflake approached us about acquiring us, we had not really considered that as an option. Our expectation was to create all of this through the original company. The thing that changed and completely blew our minds was recognizing that Snowflake wanted and needed a Streamlit in exactly the same way that we were trying to create it for the community. And that was really, really cool.</p>
    <p class="normal">It really wasn’t some new business plan that we had never thought of; it was an alignment of incentives up and down the stack. We have really complementary incentives and objectives, and it was, like, wait a minute, this is awesome. Let’s work with people to whom success means the same thing as it means to us, and not only was that true at the time of the acquisition but it is also still true now.</p>
    <p class="normal">I feel like Streamlit and Snowflake are an amazing combination and have become more aligned over time, not less, which is amazing and cool.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tyler</strong>: Absolutely. As you mentioned, there is a massive community around Streamlit that you clearly care about. It must have been a bit easier to grow that community intentionally when Streamlit was a fledgling library; how has that changed as it has grown in size?</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Adrien</strong>: The key when <a id="_idIndexMarker449"/>you’re going through these rapid scale changes (if you don’t want to destroy everything) is to be mindful of the things that got you there and the principles that are most important.</p>
    <p class="normal">From the early days of Streamlit, we did not think of the community as adjacent to the product, but we thought of the product, the forums, the website, the creators program, and the effort that we put into communication as input into the community.</p>
    <p class="normal">So, taking a step back, we like to say our principles out loud clearly and hold onto them as we scale. One of them is that the community is a living thing that matters at the core of everything. That’s true today. Another is how we talk about Streamlit, and how enthusiastic we are about the product itself. You’ll notice this in all our documentation and in the forums, where we use lots of exclamation points and emojis. We write like someone who is excited about what they’re talking about, which is true for us!</p>
    <p class="normal">The community is a living thing that is cultivated and given emotional properties, like genuine enthusiasm about data and excitement about exploration and sharing one’s work. I think this has been one of the reasons why people have found constant themes in Streamlit, even as we double and double, or triple and triple over time.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tyler</strong>: One of the things I noticed before I joined Streamlit, and continue to notice as an employee, is the emphasis on kindness. Both in interactions with the community and other employees, it was so noticeably different from other groups I had seen in the past.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Adrien</strong>: Yeah, even when I was super young, whenever I ran a group, it was a nice group. I think that was often reflected at Streamlit, from co-founders to employees and even to the types of people that we attracted into the community and the product. Over the years, these things have taken a life of their own, and the characteristics have also taken on lives of their own. For example, when we started to hire our first employees at Streamlit, we purposefully selected and screened them for kindness. And then I was a little surprised to talk to employees much later who also screened for kindness in interviews as well! Some emotional dimensions have taken on a sort of self-propelling function in the coolest possible way.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tyler</strong>: Moving on, in the first interview that we did in the prior edition of this book when we were talking about how Streamlit has changed over time, you mentioned that Streamlit is more fundamental to Python programming than it is to machine learning or data science, and how toy-like Streamlit was. How do you feel that vision has come true?</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Adrien</strong>: I totally agree. Streamlit is growing beyond just the ability to build rich and interesting apps and is starting to encompass the goal of being that visual layer on top of Python.</p>
    <p class="normal">The other part of this is <a id="_idIndexMarker450"/>that Python has so many more niches, like the fact that it is a primary language for CS education and a great language for data engineering work. It’s also a language of, just, scripting and pulling things together across a billion different APIs and file formats. So, we’re seeing apps like the GPTZero app (<a href="https://gptzero.me/"><span class="url">https://gptzero.me/</span></a>) that <a id="_idIndexMarker451"/>originated in Streamlit and does hardcore machine learning stuff, or other apps that measure and help stop human trafficking around the globe.</p>
    <p class="normal">Now there are even other examples of Streamlit apps created by GPT-3 itself. It seems that if there is any language or framework to use as the product of large language models like GPT3, Streamlit is the right target because of the super unique, super easy data flow. It really lends itself to this class of models and tightens the complexity of apps that they can create. We’re only just seeing the beginning of this, and I think it has a super rich and amazing future. I can’t wait.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tyler</strong>: Adrien, thank you so much for coming and talking with us. I was wondering if you had anything else that you wanted to talk about.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Adrien</strong>: I think a very cool thing about Streamlit is that many of our hypotheses about the trends in data science have been validated by our experience creating the product. The core idea was super simple; it wasn’t rocket science! It was a new kind of data work that was Python-native and tied together APIs, <code class="inlineCode">pandas</code>, machine learning, and all the other Python concepts. Of all the different directions, the one that I think still has so much of a greenfield area to explore is machine learning, and there are so many different angles to talk about. One we already talked about was AI generating apps, which I think is very real and we’re going to see more and more of that over the next couple of years. The other is bringing Streamlit into the ML development process more deeply as you’re building models and exploring large datasets. There is essentially an unbounded need for a visualization layer in the experience of machine learning engineers, so it’s really exciting to watch as this develops and to help it along.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tyler</strong>: Thanks again for<a id="_idIndexMarker452"/> coming on here, Adrien! You can find Adrien online on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/myelbows"><span class="url">https://twitter.com/myelbows</span></a>.</p>
    <h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-138">Gerard Bentley</h1>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tyler</strong>: Hey, Gerard! Let’s<a id="_idIndexMarker453"/> get started, I was wondering if you could give us a bit about your background. What do you do for work? What got you started in the data world?</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Gerard</strong>: Right now, I’m working on backend web services at a startup called Sensible Weather. We sell an insurance guarantee against bad weather, a new product in the climate tech space. I haven’t gotten a lot of time to use Streamlit here, but I use it for a couple of things internally that haven’t completely been deployed yet.</p>
    <p class="normal">Previously, I worked at a mortgage company, doing mostly batch ETL work, where I got a bit of exposure to data science and predictive models in finance. There, it was fun to build something internal in Streamlit to visualize what would happen if a person’s credit score were higher, or if they put more principal down, etc. Before Streamlit we didn’t have a tool to answer those questions quickly.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tyler</strong>: So, you were mostly focused on models created by the data science team, and creating the interactive apps that are used to demo the models, right? What got you into the data world?</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Gerard</strong>: I did a year of AI research with Professor Osborn at Pomona College after my undergrad, where we explored computer vision on classic video games. We trained convolutional neural networks and built out data pipelines to record gameplay screenshots and tag training data.</p>
    <p class="normal">This was before Streamlit existed. I was building out interfaces that loaded an image, asked the user to tag image features, and then saved the new training data. But it took me months to learn JavaScript, Nginx, and Docker enough to deploy a useful Flask app.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tyler</strong>: I have a lot of experience trying to create projects in Flask and Django, and they’re extremely difficult to work with. So, then, after these experiences, how did you get your introduction to Streamlit? </p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Gerard</strong>: I heard about it while I was doing a remote teaching gig at AI Camp. One teacher suggested that I use it with students. One Python beginner was able to start a personal website in a day, and then add images and interactivity on their own during that week. They built out a full computer vision app, which gave them a lot of confidence and was really impressive in my eyes. So, that’s where I got started with Streamlit, and then I started making small side projects to try and understand new things at work and on my own.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tyler</strong>: That’s very cool. A lot of apps are pedagogical, where your goal is to teach someone something, either students or different partners within work. So what was your “aha” moment with Streamlit? At what point did you realize that you really liked the library? </p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Gerard</strong>: I think I saw it early on. When it took only a day or so for a student to run a YOLO computer vision web app with webcam support. And I just knew it had taken me weeks to build an app like that with HTML and JavaScript. From then, I understood that this could be used to interact with any machine learning model.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tyler</strong>: Since then, you’ve made lots of different Streamlit apps. What did your learning curve with Streamlit look like? Did you feel like it ramped up really fast, and then you plateaued? Was it easy to learn, hard to master, or hard to learn, easy to master? Or even continuous?</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Gerard</strong>: Definitely fast to ramp up. To learn, I went through the gallery and copied the source code of apps I wanted to mimic. Then, I would make changes to make them my own. I was pretty comfortable with Python already, so this process went smoothly.</p>
    <p class="normal">Easy to learn, and then harder to master. When I was trying to do things from traditional web apps, such as the client state and async functions, I had to search the forums and web for solutions.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tyler</strong>: That’s my<a id="_idIndexMarker454"/> experience as well. So, why do you create Streamlit apps like your Fidelity app (<a href="https://github.com/gerardrbentley/fidelity-account-overview"><span class="url">https://github.com/gerardrbentley/fidelity-account-overview</span></a>)? As part of the journey to master Streamlit?</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" role="presentation" src="../Images/B18444_12_01.png"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 12.1: Gerard’s Streamlit app</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Gerard</strong>: Part of it is to build a portfolio that I can show companies who might hire me. Part of it is my own interests; these are apps that I want to build mostly for myself and see if they will work. Streamlit is the fastest way to do that for me at the moment.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tyler</strong>: On the Fidelity app, was it more “I’m starting to look at new jobs and I want to develop a portfolio” or more on the side of “I have this personal problem I’m trying to figure out”?</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Gerard</strong>: That <a id="_idIndexMarker455"/>example was a strong mix of both. I wanted to build a dashboard for myself for my own data, so it was a personal problem. At the same time, I was thinking about a project that might demonstrate data analysis skills for applying to data science roles. Other apps have a focus on backend concepts, which were great to reference in interviews.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tyler</strong>: How long did the Fidelity app take? And how did you get the idea? Can you talk me through the build and thought process?</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Gerard</strong>: I’d say version one took probably 4 hours of coding time and researching time. I was pretty confident in my skills to load a DataFrame from a CSV file from my computer, and I had built a handful of apps with a file drop input, which Streamlit makes really straightforward. Loading the data was easy enough, then I had to clean it, present it, and add filters.</p>
    <p class="normal">The most time-consuming part of building it was making the visuals. In my experience, Plotly has the nicest default charts, so that helped me try out a mix of charts without a ton of code.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tyler</strong>: Four hours for the first version of the Fidelity app, and then what happened after that?</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Gerard</strong>: After that, I basically thought, oh, how can I share this? How could I let someone else use this easily without having to run Streamlit on their computer? So, that included a usable description and then some niceties around adding colors and using Streamlit AG Grid.</p>
    <p class="normal">That was an extra 2 hours of work or so, to clean up and make it pretty. Then, I was happy with it being out in the wild. This was after I had read the first version of your book and DM’d you on Twitter about it. Then, you shared the app and I immediately thought, oh I should make this a little prettier.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tyler</strong>: I really enjoyed the app! Have you ever thought about charging for an app? Maybe figuring out how to charge for more than basic features?</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Gerard</strong>: I’ve thought about that a little. Some apps that I have built, such as a QR code maker (<a href="https://github.com/gerardrbentley/flash_qr"><span class="url">https://github.com/gerardrbentley/flash_qr</span></a>), are similar to existing Software-as-a-Service products, but I just made a version for fun. I definitely think some apps would work with a tiered or freemium structure, but I’ve never put in the effort.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tyler</strong>: After you <a id="_idIndexMarker456"/>posted about the app, what was your first interaction with the Streamlit community? Broadly, what happened from there? Did people, like, reach out to you via GitHub or Twitter, or what was the response?</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Gerard</strong>: After that point, I posted a few things about the app, and people started following me on GitHub and forked the code. That’s the main interaction I’ve seen.</p>
    <p class="normal">And then the viewership metrics feature came out on Streamlit Community Cloud, and I saw that people were using the app every month, or at least viewing it!</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tyler</strong>: After building your first set of apps, are there big things that you wish you would have known earlier? Maybe about Streamlit flow, storing, state, or caching?</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Gerard</strong>: Definitely using forms to stop re-runs is important. I made a couple of apps that did time-series forecasting, and whenever you change one slider, it’s going to trigger a change everywhere. But if you keep that in a form, then you can control the execution a little better.</p>
    <p class="normal">When I got started, there were fewer of the control flow functions such as <code class="inlineCode">st.stop()</code> or <code class="inlineCode">st.experimental_rerun()</code>. But now, I use those to keep code from nesting really far in a bunch of <code class="inlineCode">if</code> statements. Also showing a warning with why the app stopped is good, because the user never knows as much as you know about your app.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tyler</strong>: I just<a id="_idIndexMarker457"/> wanted to say thanks for the great interview. I really like all of your apps!

    <h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-139">Arnaud Miribel and Zachary Blackwood</h1>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tyler</strong>: Hey Zachary and Arnaud! First, do you each want to tell everyone a bit about yourself?</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Zachary</strong>: As you <a id="_idIndexMarker458"/>mentioned, I’m Zachary Blackwood. I started off as a teacher and then when that wouldn’t pay the bills, I switched to web development and then got sucked into the data team there because they were using Python, and that sounded like fun.</p>
    <p class="normal">I was with a little AG tech startup that got acquired by a larger organization, where I learned a lot about infrastructure and data engineering. While I was there, I built various dashboards for the data science team, and we tried out several different frameworks. A friend of mine showed me Streamlit, and this may be me getting ahead of myself, but I loved it.</p>
    <p class="normal">Later, the same friend told me that he had a friend who worked at Streamlit and was looking for a data engineer. I immediately applied, and here I am! Now, I work on the data team at Streamlit.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Arnaud</strong>: Hey everyone, I’m<a id="_idIndexMarker459"/> Arnaud Miribel. I have done data science for over five years now. I started working in a few companies that had domain expertise in a few different fields, which is something I’ve always loved about data science: you can get into anything. The first one was in the legal field working on court decisions <a id="_idIndexMarker460"/>with <strong class="keyWord">Natural Language Processing</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">NLP</strong>). Another one was a hospital, and I did machine learning on medical reports. Another one was working in the continuing education space, teaching machine learning to a lot of folks.</p>
    <p class="normal">At the last two companies, I used Streamlit and loved it. I thought it was the greatest thing ever; it suddenly made my life so much easier. It was so different from all my student projects where I was struggling with either Plotly, Jupyter, or Flask. So, when I discovered, it was super happy.</p>
    <p class="normal">I was on Twitter and saw that Johannes, who had a similar background to me, had started to work at Streamlit while living in Berlin. That was quite a surprise, as I always thought Streamlit was SF Bay Area only! I DM’d him on Twitter, and he had me meet with Adrien, and then… I started working for Streamlit. That was about two years ago, and that’s how I got started.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tyler</strong>: It’s funny how things work like that sometimes; I know I found out about Streamlit via Twitter. So, then, both of you are on the data team at Streamlit with me, and you two have spent all this time over the course of the past 6 months or so building a library<a id="_idIndexMarker461"/> called <code class="inlineCode">streamlit-extras</code> (<a href="https://extras.streamlitapp.com/"><span class="url">https://extras.streamlitapp.com/</span></a>), which contains a lot of the mini tools we have built on the Streamlit data team over the years. Can you talk a bit about the central problem that inspired you?</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Arnaud</strong>: In some ways, it <a id="_idIndexMarker462"/>was a little selfish because we wanted to have some way to share all of our findings. And then we realized that it was an open-source product that we should share with everyone, a way for us to show our experiences and teachings from being heavy Streamlit users. We also wanted to release it as an experiment of sorts, to see what the community did with it and to take inspiration and build on that.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tyler</strong>: So, when you say experiences and teachings, what are some of the things that you mean?</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Arnaud</strong>: Within the data team, we have one large multi-page app that we develop. In it, there are a lot of visual functions or hacks that we do on top of Streamlit as ways to augment it visually and make the viewer experience better. So, we wanted to isolate those and make them into a single package.</p>
    <p class="normal">There are also some functions that just make things faster for data scientists, like systematically making charts always show the underlying DataFrames and a button that exports the data to a CSV file. We wanted to package all of these things together because they really just fit together as Components, and we thought it would make sense to call a group of small Components extras!</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Zachary</strong>: The other source <a id="_idIndexMarker463"/>of these extras, other than functions that we’re using internally, is the community forum! We all spend some time on that on a regular basis and it is interesting to see the kinds of problems people have, and how they approach them. There are often very common kinds of problems that take a little bit of setup code but work fairly well once you have that setup. A simple example of one that just takes a little bit of extra CSS is when people wanted to have a logo on the top left of their app above their list of pages in a multi-page app. It turns out it’s not very hard to do that, but we have seen people ask about it multiple times. So, we made that into a function, and put that function in <code class="inlineCode">streamlit-extras</code> (<a href="https://extras.streamlit.app/App%20logo"><span class="url">https://extras.streamlit.app/App%20logo</span></a>). A number of the extras have come directly out of somebody who asked for something in the forum. And we either figured it out, or someone else figured it out, and we added it to extras to make it more discoverable and easier to make sure you don’t repeat yourself.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tyler</strong>: Some of my<a id="_idIndexMarker464"/> favorite extras are the one that makes it much easier to add headers with a solid colored line under them (<a href="https://extras.streamlit.app/Color%20ya%20Headers"><span class="url">https://extras.streamlit.app/Color%20ya%20Headers</span></a>) and the data explorer extra (<a href="https://extras.streamlit.app/Dataframe%20explorer%20UI"><span class="url">https://extras.streamlit.app/Dataframe%20explorer%20UI</span></a>). Do you two have some favorites?</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" role="presentation" src="../Images/B18444_12_02.png"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 12.2: Explorer</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Arnaud</strong>: My favorite<a id="_idIndexMarker465"/> is one of the latest ones that was added called “chart container” (<a href="https://extras.streamlit.app/Chart%20container"><span class="url">https://extras.streamlit.app/Chart%20container</span></a>), which is a super efficient API for creating a BI component quickly. So you can, whenever you’re working with a DataFrame, create a plot, show the DataFrame, and also export it to a CSV in one function.</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" role="presentation" src="../Images/B18444_12_03.png"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 12.3: Chart Container</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Zachary</strong>: I like that <a id="_idIndexMarker466"/>one as well! I have one that we don’t use internally but is something that comes up all the time. People get confused or frustrated by the fact that when they click a button, it does not “stay clicked” after they do something else on the page. This happens because of the model that Streamlit has, which is to re-run the script from the top down on each interaction. People sometimes expect it to work more like a checkbox, in that you click it and it remembers that it has been clicked.</p>
    <p class="normal">The extra that we made is called Stateful Button (<a href="https://extras.streamlit.app/Stateful%20Button"><span class="url">https://extras.streamlit.app/Stateful%20Button</span></a>), which stays clicked across re-runs. It’s a simple one but I think it’s nice, and it solves a problem that people seem to have out in the wild.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tyler</strong>: I see all these extras as a way, if you’re an individual developer on a team, to understand best practices and get a leg up on using Streamlit. One unmentioned one so far is called Chart annotations (<a href="https://extras.streamlit.app/Chart%20annotations"><span class="url">https://extras.streamlit.app/Chart%20annotations</span></a>), which lets you put clickable annotations on graphs. I think it’s a wonderful extra for use at work, when you want to be able to explain large movements in graphs on the graph itself:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" role="presentation" src="../Images/B18444_12_04.png"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 12.4: Annotations</p>
    <p class="normal">In terms of the development of the library itself, what were some of the difficulties in developing something like this?</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Zachary</strong>: It actually <a id="_idIndexMarker467"/>started as something called <code class="inlineCode">st-hub</code>! We wanted to make Components and functions easy to discover all in one place. That project turned into its own thing, but a big part of that was building this gallery that we have on <a href="http://extras.streamlit.app"><span class="url">http://extras.streamlit.app</span></a>. It’s been a fun process for both of us. Right now, the gallery is dynamically based on the source code of each extra and some dunder variables (<a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/dunder-variables/"><span class="url">https://www.pythonmorsels.com/dunder-variables/</span></a>) that you set. Then, it builds all of the pages that you see on the main gallery page with the code, the docstrings, the usage examples, etc. That was one of my favorite parts about <code class="inlineCode">streamlit-extras</code> — the technical challenge and the clever solutions for making this kind of dynamically generated page. We spent all this time on it because we wanted to make the barrier as low as possible so other people in the community could contribute.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Arnaud</strong>: I agree, the<a id="_idIndexMarker468"/> gallery is probably 75% of the work. The funny part is that the challenge was not so clear at the beginning, the motivation for why we really wanted to do this. But we knew we really wanted to have projects within the Streamlit team to be more discoverable and also wanted to make Components more discoverable and easier to create, so we thought this would be a good community start.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tyler</strong>: One of the difficulties that I’ve had writing this book is that I realistically, could write many chapters on Components. And in all likelihood, I would have to teach a sufficient amount of CSS, HTML, or JavaScript, or with Python, I would have to show folks how to create and upload packages to PyPI. There is an extremely large jump between creating beautiful Streamlit apps and creating Components.</p>
    <p class="normal">That’s one of the biggest reasons I wanted to have the two of you on, to encourage people to start their component creation journey with <code class="inlineCode">streamlit-extras</code> (<a href="https://extras.streamlit.app/Contribute"><span class="url">https://extras.streamlit.app/Contribute</span></a>).</p>
    <p class="normal">I always close out these interviews by asking if the guests have anything else to say or have anything else they wanted to chat about. The floor is yours!</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Zachary</strong>: It was at <a id="_idIndexMarker469"/>the company before Streamlit that I started creating open-source packages for the first time, and even though they weren’t used terribly much beyond my own team, I really enjoyed being part of the open-source ecosystem. And now it has been really fun to work on a project that is widely used and has a strong user base and is being actively developed. I think there are a lot of ways that Streamlit could make it easier to contribute, but I’m really just excited to be a part of the community and get to pass this work along. It has been really fun to create things for my team that solves their problems, and then throwing it out on the forums for others to use is pretty fun too.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Arnaud</strong>: Exactly<a id="_idIndexMarker470"/> what he said. I would encourage anyone to try out <code class="inlineCode">streamlit-extras</code> and have fun and tell us what they think is good or bad about it. And more generally, this was the first time I made an open-source contribution and it is very rewarding because you get people that use it, and reference it even in things like YouTube videos. Ultimately it is a commitment too, as you get pressure from people that open PRs or issues and you realize that something looks bad or doesn’t work as expected. I would encourage people to try it out and try building their own open-source packages because it is really a nice adventure.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tyler</strong>: Thank you two so much for coming out and chatting with us! You can find Zachary on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/blackary"><span class="url">https://github.com/blackary</span></a> and on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/blackaryz"><span class="url">https://twitter.com/blackaryz</span></a>, and you can find Arnaud on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/arnaudmiribel"><span class="url">https://github.com/arnaudmiribel</span></a> and on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/arnaudmiribel"><span class="url">https://twitter.com/arnaudmiribel</span></a>.</p>
    <h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-140">Yuichiro Tachibana</h1>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tyler</strong>: Hey, Yuichiro, so great to do this with you! Do you want to get started by introducing yourself to everyone? Talk a bit about your background.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Yuichiro</strong>: OK, so I am Yuichiro <a id="_idIndexMarker471"/>Tachibana and I am currently in Japan. I’m also a member of the Streamlit Creators program and am developing and maintaining some Streamlit libraries. My personal OSS projects are hosted on GitHub!</p>
    <p class="normal">As far as my background, I studied computer vision and applications of machine learning at my university. I worked with people who built robots, and software was necessary to help build robotic intelligence, especially in computer vision. This is why my knowledge of computer vision and machine learning is more practical than theoretical.</p>
    <p class="normal">After that, I took a year off from university and started my own personal project with some financial support from the Japanese government where I built a deep learning accelerator based on<a id="_idIndexMarker472"/> a <strong class="keyWord">Field-Programmable Gate Array</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">FPGA</strong>). I used very low-level stuff at the time; this was around 2014. </p>
    <p class="normal">Then, I went to work for a commercial company where I was working on various projects from NLP to computer vision, focused on commercial products. At that time, my main skills gradually changed to have a more software development focus rather than just computer vision or machine learning.</p>
    <p class="normal">At this company, I started working on a web-based video streaming recording system, which had some similar parts to the <code class="inlineCode">Streamlit-webrtc</code> component that I eventually built.</p>
    <p class="normal">Then, I moved to a company that my friend started, and I worked on more structured data. I was a software engineer, and I built internal applications to show some data or some analytical results based on logs. That’s when I started using Streamlit heavily.</p>
    <p class="normal">And now, I have no job. I’m taking a break, and that’s a long bit of self-introduction!</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tyler</strong>: Very cool, what a fun journey. Did you learn about Streamlit when you did the web streaming work, or mostly with the last company you were with?</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Yuichiro</strong>: I actually started with Streamlit at my first company where I worked as a software developer. I worked with some researchers in the field of computer vision, who usually showed me their demos using OpenCV. They would carry their laptops over to my seat and show me how cool their work was! My first motivation was to look into alternative tools for them to use to create some portable and shareable demos. I think I originally found Streamlit through Twitter, actually.</p>
    <p class="normal">After that, I couldn’t<a id="_idIndexMarker473"/> find anything that could help me do real-time video streaming in Streamlit, so I built <code class="inlineCode">Streamlit-webrtc</code> (<a href="https://github.com/whitphx/streamlit-webrtc"><span class="url">https://github.com/whitphx/streamlit-webrtc</span></a>), which is a component that lets you handle real-time video and audio streams in Streamlit.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tyler</strong>: I think <code class="inlineCode">Streamlit-webrtc</code> is really cool, not just because it is useful but also because it seems very, very difficult to produce. Do you want to talk about the development of the component a bit? How are people using it?</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" role="presentation" src="../Images/B18444_12_05.png"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 12.5: WebRTC</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Yuichiro</strong>: First of all, thank you very much. I think the original motivation for creating and developing this library was to help computer vision researchers or software developers who want to create demos on top of their models and a live video stream. So, from my point of view, it replaces parts of OpenCV.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tyler</strong>: I think this also leads into your work with stlite (<a href="https://github.com/whitphx/stlite"><span class="url">https://github.com/whitphx/stlite</span></a>), which is a serverless version of Streamlit and essentially means you can share a Streamlit app with someone and they can run it locally in their browser without having to do any of the Python setup for the app. Can you talk us through a bit of your motivations in building stlite? What was the central problem there?</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" role="presentation" src="../Images/B18444_12_06.png"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 12.6: stlite</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Yuichiro</strong>: Well, where should I start? At first, I started by looking at Jupyter, where Jupyter is similar to Streamlit because it abstracts away some of the front-end code and hides it from the developers so the developers can mostly write Python code. And then I saw that Jupyter could be turned into web assembly, which meant that it could be run in the browser and run <a id="_idIndexMarker474"/>entirely locally. At that point, I knew I could do the same thing with Streamlit.</p>
    <p class="normal">I also had this emotion, this opinion, that the offline experience was important. That some people would want a privacy-focused experience where everything was running locally.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tyler</strong>: Right, there are some things that you want to have centralized, and there are some things where you really want to use your own computer for. There are thin and thick clients everywhere!</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Yuichiro</strong>: Exactly. During my work with the deep learning accelerator, I had a hypothesis that the offline, local capability is beneficial especially for computer vision or machine learning stuff, primarily because of privacy.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tyler</strong>: Then, you had this big opinion about the importance of privacy and local development, and then you also had this technical idea for a solution with WebAssembly. Where did it go from there?</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Yuichiro</strong>: At that point, I had the idea, but I knew it would be really difficult. It took maybe half a year before I even started after I got the idea. There were some discussions on the Streamlit forum, but I couldn’t find a clear way to solve the technical problem from an implementation standpoint.</p>
    <p class="normal">That all changed in late April 2022, with the launch of<a id="_idIndexMarker475"/> PyScript (<a href="https://pyscript.net/"><span class="url">https://pyscript.net/</span></a>), which lets you run Python in your browser. It was a potential idea competitor, and after I saw it, I decided to bring all my power into this project. And I started <a id="_idIndexMarker476"/>development the next week.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tyler</strong>: That is awesome; I recommend stlite to many people that are just starting out with Streamlit because they don’t have to do any of their own development setup. They can just start coding and then it’s there; it is like magic.</p>
    <p class="normal">In your mind, where does it go from here?</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Yuichiro</strong>: I have so many to-do items on my list related to it. But I still don’t have a 100% clear image of what we’ll be able to do in the future. So, first of all, I would like you and the audience of this interview to let me know about interesting applications of stlite. If you have any ideas, please let me know! </p>
    <p class="normal">Some other applications could be with edge computing, like Cloudflare and its edge computing services, which are based on WebAssembly but don’t support Python. Maybe we could integrate there.</p>
    <p class="normal">Industrial companies could also use stlite to create commercial-level products that run the Streamlit applications on the client side, to reduce their server cost, or if a major part of their customers consider data privacy strongly, as you said.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tyler</strong>: Switching to another subject, you clearly have spent an insane amount of time contributing to the Streamlit component ecosystem and the forums; what is it about the library and community that keeps you around?</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Yuichiro</strong>: I would say I have three reasons.</p>
    <p class="normal">First, the technical design of Streamlit. The library is designed so it hits that critical point between simplicity and extensibility. It is an extremely great API design. Streamlit also helps me a lot with realizing my technical interests and technical ideas as a real-world application and hosting and sharing that application with users or colleagues.</p>
    <p class="normal">Second is the community and company. The company itself loves the community too, and I think they pay a lot of money and put in a lot of effort to manage and keep the community itself. And there are many dedicated community organizers who pay so much attention to maintaining the health of the community, including me. It makes me feel comfortable working with Streamlit.</p>
    <p class="normal">And the third reason is Streamlit’s extensibility. This is the reason why I selected it in the first place. There was no other choice for me to create a real-time video streaming component on top of!</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tyler</strong>: Those are some great reasons. I just wanted to give you a chance at the end of the interview to pitch anything else that you’re working on or talk about anything that you’re thinking about.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Yuichiro</strong>: I don’t have much else to talk about, but I’d like to say that I love open-source software. At a high level, whenever you use open-source software, there are developers all around the world who have created it for free, and you can use it to express your intention, your dedication, and your interest to the world with very interesting original stuff. So, this is my self-promotion for developers all over the world, I’d say. With that, you should express your<a id="_idIndexMarker477"/> interest to the world whenever you can, and then you should also do your best to contribute and support the OSS ecosystem. Sponsor some of these projects so developers can keep making products that you use!</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tyler</strong>: Thanks again Yuichiro! Yuichiro can be found on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/whitphx"><span class="url">https://github.com/whitphx</span></a> and on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/whitphx"><span class="url">https://twitter.com/whitphx</span></a>.</p>
