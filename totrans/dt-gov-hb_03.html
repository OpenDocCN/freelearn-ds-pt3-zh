			<h1 id="_idParaDest-59"><a id="_idTextAnchor058"/>Building a High-Performing Team</h1>
			<p>Establishing a high-performing data governance team is a critical and long-term investment in the success of the company’s use of data. By reading this chapter, I assume you are looking to build a high-performing data governance team and/or create an entire data and analytics function. Ultimately, your success will depend on the team you assemble to deliver excellent, high-quality impactful solutions for your organization. Given the scarcity of talented data professionals, this is the second most critical indicator of your success; that is, hiring the best possible talent you can afford for your company (the first being able to set and measure what success is, as I covered in <a href="B18846_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor041"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">How to Build a Coalition of Advocates</em> and <a href="B18846_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor110"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Define Success &amp; Align </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">on Outcomes</em></span><span class="No-Break">).</span></p>
			<p>Depending on your company’s unique situation, you may encounter a few different scenarios that have led to your need to build a team. You might be the first hire for data and have to build an entire team from scratch. You could have been brought in to bring together disparate teams across your company to unify them under your leadership. Or, you could have inherited an entirely intact existing team in need of a transformation. No matter which situation you find yourself in, the performance of the team sits firmly on your shoulders from the moment you walk in <span class="No-Break">the door.</span></p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will discuss what roles matter and why, how to structure the team for success, how to implement the right routines and rhythms, and how to grow talent both within your team and across your company. As you might have assumed, establishing a high-performing data governance team is a critical and long-term investment in the success of the company’s use of data. <strong class="bold">Chief Data and Analytics Officers</strong> (<strong class="bold">CDAOs</strong>) and offices of the CDAO only began to be established in 2002 (first, at <em class="italic">Capital One</em>), and as recently as 2012, only 100 CDAOs existed globally. However, in the last few years, the number of CDAOs has grown to over 152,000, according to <em class="italic">LinkedIn</em> data. The role of <strong class="bold">Chief Data Officer</strong> (<strong class="bold">CDO</strong>) is much more common, with 67.9% of major companies reported to have appointed a CDO, up from 12% in 2012. With demand for CDAO roles emerging at a rapid pace and the salary of these specialists rising to match demand, the <strong class="bold">return on investment</strong> (<strong class="bold">ROI</strong>) of these roles is under constant scrutiny. It is critical for the success of the office of the CDAO to build a high-performing team quickly, efficiently, and with effective measures <span class="No-Break">of value.</span></p>
			<p>We will cover the following <span class="No-Break">main topics:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Optimizing <span class="No-Break">for outcomes</span></li>
				<li>Three common data <span class="No-Break">organization models</span></li>
				<li>What roles <span class="No-Break">are needed</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">AI considerations</span></li>
				<li>How to structure the team for results (<span class="No-Break">and why)</span></li>
				<li>Building the rhythm of the business <span class="No-Break">of data</span></li>

				<li><span class="No-Break">Talent development</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-60"><a id="_idTextAnchor059"/>Optimizing for outcomes</h1>
			<p>As you set out to design an organizational model and operational model for how your company will deliver data <a id="_idIndexMarker136"/>management and analytics outcomes that matter, you must begin with the end in mind. You are not building a single department; you are building a data-empowered enterprise. Long before you begin to design an organizational model, you must define what capabilities you need to deliver. The capabilities are a major outcome of the conversations you held when building your coalition of advocates out of the process outlined in <a href="B18846_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor041"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">How to Build a Coalition </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">of Advocates</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Use case</p>
			<p class="callout">In one of my previous companies, there was a large and critical focus on the quality of data used in reporting. As a result, much of our data strategy was anchored on one major capability: rearchitecting the data infrastructure to drive a streamlined and curated data ecosystem that could produce high-quality reports with a high degree of reusability of common data elements that fed these reports. This ensured common data elements were reliable and of high quality. It was a clear and focused plan based on a specific outcome that the company organized and <span class="No-Break">optimized around.</span></p>
			<p class="callout">As a result, the largest portion of headcount was focused on creating authorized provisioning points, ensuring we had a comprehensive and reliable data lake and that we deployed strong data governance across all environments. Analytics and data science were combined into one leader, whereas the data management components were broken out and reported directly to the CDAO due to the importance of these capabilities and the low maturity level. This allowed for more direct oversight and focus of the CDAO over data management since that was our major investment and <span class="No-Break">focus area.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-61"><a id="_idTextAnchor060"/>Common outcomes</h2>
			<p>There are endless combinations of outcomes that a data and analytics team may be focused on at any given time, with<a id="_idIndexMarker137"/> new focuses emerging all the time. At the time of this writing, <strong class="bold">generative artificial intelligence</strong> (<strong class="bold">GenAI</strong>) has taken the forefront of much of the innovation space, and thus, the emergence of the importance of high-quality data is moving back to the top of the CDAO agenda. The important consideration is, as we discussed in <a href="B18846_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor041"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">How to Build a Coalition of Advocates</em> evaluating company strategy to ensure that what you are prioritizing is supporting the needs of the business. The following are 10 common outcomes <a id="_idIndexMarker138"/>expected from establishing a high-performing team that have held throughout my data <span class="No-Break">governance experience:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Improved decision-making</strong>: A high-performing data management team enables faster, more accurate decisions by ensuring the data that is relied upon is accurate, up-to-date, and <span class="No-Break">easily accessible.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Increased efficiency</strong>: By establishing clear protocols and processes for data entry, storage, and retrieval, a high-performing data management team minimizes time wasted on searching for data or correcting errors, thereby increasing <span class="No-Break">organizational efficiency.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data security</strong>: They ensure that sensitive data is protected, compliant with relevant regulations (such as the <strong class="bold">General Data Protection Regulation</strong> (<strong class="bold">GDPR</strong>), the <strong class="bold">California Consumer Privacy Act</strong> (<strong class="bold">CCPA</strong>), and so<a id="_idIndexMarker139"/> on), and only accessible to <span class="No-Break">authorized</span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker140"/></span><span class="No-Break"> individuals.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Enhanced data quality</strong>: They implement data validation and cleansing processes to maintain the high quality of data, reducing the risk of decisions made based on <span class="No-Break">erroneous information.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Scalability</strong>: A well-organized data management team prepares for the future growth of an organization, making sure data infrastructure is scalable and can handle an increased amount of data as the <span class="No-Break">company expands.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Improved customer experience</strong>: By managing customer data effectively, the team can help other departments in<a id="_idIndexMarker141"/> personalizing the customer experience, predicting customer needs, and promptly responding to inquiries <span class="No-Break">or issues.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Innovation and insights</strong>: High-performing data management teams can aid in identifying patterns and trends within data, leading to new insights that drive innovation and <span class="No-Break">strategic planning.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data literacy</strong>: Such a team can also help improve data literacy within the organization, equipping employees with the understanding and skills needed to use data effectively in <span class="No-Break">their roles.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Regulatory compliance</strong>: Good data management ensures that the company is compliant with industry standards and regulations related to data privacy and management, preventing potential legal issues <span class="No-Break">and penalties.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Cost savings</strong>: Proper data management can lead to significant cost savings over time. These savings could come from improved efficiencies, reduction in errors, or preventing expensive data breaches and <span class="No-Break">non-compliance penalties.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>You can use this list of outcomes as a part of the justification for pulling a data team together. If you need a jumping-off point, select ones from this list that make sense for your business needs. You should customize areas of need, add new outcomes, and delete ones that do <span class="No-Break">not apply.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-62"><a id="_idTextAnchor061"/>Defining core functions</h2>
			<p>Up until this point, we have <a id="_idIndexMarker142"/>spent time defining data governance and exploring how to build outstanding partnerships, and now, the harder work begins. As the leader, your job is to take these inputs and start to shape your team. As there are an unlimited number of combinations of how to arrange data professionals into a team, I will walk you through some common patterns to get you started. Don’t be afraid to deviate based on the needs of your company. Key questions to consider are <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>What are your core capabilities going <span class="No-Break">to be?</span></li>
				<li>What will the team’s <span class="No-Break">priorities be?</span></li>
				<li>What is urgent and requires immediate attention versus what <span class="No-Break">can wait?</span></li>
				<li>What do I, as the leader, need to be most engaged in? What do I need to stay <span class="No-Break">closest to?</span></li>
				<li>What gaps in talent do I have within the team that may impact who needs my time and attention <span class="No-Break">over others?</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The answers to these questions will help determine which models make the most sense to drive the structure of your team. We will explore three foundational options for designing the data function and the pros and cons of each. As you continue to review these options, do not get hung up on which model is a perfect fit. A perfect fit does not exist. These organizational designs are templates to leverage for your <span class="No-Break">team design.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-63"><a id="_idTextAnchor062"/>Incorporating product management in organizational design</h2>
			<p>More recently, data<a id="_idIndexMarker143"/> governance teams and analytics teams have made an intentional shift to adopting <a id="_idIndexMarker144"/>core product management principles in data capability delivery. This shift has captivated companies both large and small due to the overwhelming benefits seen by focusing on doing fewer small, one-time deliveries, with a focus on long-term, sustained deliveries in lower quantity but <span class="No-Break">higher quality.</span></p>
			<p>Just as product management in the software development world focuses on creating and maintaining successful products, data product management involves treating data as a valuable asset and developing a strategic approach to its organization and utilization. Here’s how you can incorporate product management in your <span class="No-Break">organization design:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong class="bold">Identifying stakeholders and their needs</strong>. Just as in product management, understanding the needs of stakeholders is crucial in data organization design. Data organizations should identify the various teams, departments, and individuals that interact with data and gather their requirements. This helps in aligning data solutions with the specific needs of <span class="No-Break">end users.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Defining clear objectives and goals</strong>. Data product management involves setting clear objectives and goals for data initiatives. This could include improving data accessibility and accuracy or enabling data-driven decision-making. By defining these <a id="_idIndexMarker145"/>objectives, data organizations can stay focused on what needs to be achieved and measure <span class="No-Break">their success.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Prioritizing data initiatives</strong>. Similar to how product managers prioritize features and enhancements based on business value and user impact, data organizations should prioritize data initiatives based on their importance and potential impact on the organization’s goals. This ensures that resources are <span class="No-Break">allocated efficiently.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Iterative development and agile practices</strong>. Adopting iterative development methodologies and agile practices in data organization design enables continuous improvement. This approach allows data teams to iterate on their solutions based on user feedback, adapt to changing requirements, and respond to emerging business <span class="No-Break">needs effectively.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">User-centric design</strong>. Just as product managers focus on creating user-friendly products, data organizations should prioritize user-centric data design. This means providing data in a format that is easy to understand and use for end users and designing data solutions with the end-user experience <span class="No-Break">in mind.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data documentation and communication</strong>. Effective product management involves clear documentation and communication. Similarly, data organizations should document data definitions, data sources, and data lineage, making it easier for stakeholders to understand and use the <span class="No-Break">data effectively.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Performance measurement and metrics</strong> (<em class="italic">yes, data about data!</em>). Data product management requires<a id="_idIndexMarker146"/> measuring the performance of data initiatives against set goals and KPIs. By tracking metrics related to data usage, data quality, and data accessibility, data organizations can continuously assess their performance and make <span class="No-Break">data-driven improvements.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>By adopting these product management principles, data organizations can ensure that their data infrastructure is aligned with business objectives, delivers value to stakeholders, and remains adaptable to evolving requirements in the dynamic world of data. As we explore common data organizational models in the rest of this chapter, I will pull through the concept of product management such that we incorporate these principles into our <span class="No-Break">organizational design.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-64"><a id="_idTextAnchor063"/>Three common data organization models</h1>
			<p>The roles you need should be determined by what you need to achieve. Truly, there are endless possibilities for how<a id="_idIndexMarker147"/> an organization could and should structure its team for success, and only you can design the right team for your unique situation. However, in the following pages, I will outline four types of data functions you may need to lead and suggest a few different organizational structures that will enable the four types to deliver successfully. It is your job, as the leader of the data function, to select which of the four types is appropriate for your <span class="No-Break">organization’s objectives.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-65"><a id="_idTextAnchor064"/>Establishing the office of the CDO</h2>
			<p>Regardless of your <a id="_idIndexMarker148"/>company’s data and analytic needs, organizations should have at least a small, central function. I will refer to this central<a id="_idIndexMarker149"/> function as the office of the CDO. Depending on your organizational structure selected, you may have a larger size and scoped office or a smaller size and scoped office. Ideally, this central office of the CDO will be responsible for setting the expectations, policies, and standards that the organization will adhere to. At a minimum, the central function will own the responsibility for setting these requirements and should also be responsible for implementation and ongoing monitoring <span class="No-Break">of compliance.</span></p>
			<p>Without establishing a central function that holds responsibility for requirements, implementation of the requirements, and ongoing monitoring of compliance, the various <strong class="bold">business units</strong> (<strong class="bold">BUs</strong>) will be left to their own requirements, implementation practices, and ongoing monitoring, which will<a id="_idIndexMarker150"/> result in inconsistencies in how data is managed as a company. If an organization wants to manage data well, it must establish this central group at a<a id="_idIndexMarker151"/> bare minimum. To maintain objectivity and remove bias in the policies and monitoring practices established by the office of the CDO, the leader of the Office of the CDO should report to as neutral of a location in the company <span class="No-Break">as possible.</span></p>
			<h3>Federated data office model – office of the CDO</h3>
			<p>If a narrowly defined centralized office of the CDO is defined as outlined previously, the requirements set by this office will <a id="_idIndexMarker152"/>need to be implemented by the respective BUs. This model is “federated,” whereas the office of the CDO does the bare minimum, and the BUs and respective corporate functions (for example, finance, sales, R&amp;D) must do all the implementation work. In this model, divisions may or may not have divisional CDOs in place to drive the requirements within the respective divisions. They may also be empowered to design and implement their own capabilities to comply with the office of the CDO’s <span class="No-Break">enterprise policies:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer022" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/3.1.jpg" alt="Figure 3.1 – Office of the CDO in the federated model"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.1 – Office of the CDO in the federated model</p>
			<p>This model empowers the BUs and corporate functions to create capabilities that are needed for their own needs but makes it difficult to connect the capabilities together for an enterprise-wide view of data. Often, organizations begin with a model such as this, which favors the needs of each BU/corporate function without taking into account the enterprise and often<a id="_idIndexMarker153"/> necessitates a rationalization effort once data efforts become prioritized and <span class="No-Break">more formalized.</span></p>
			<p>To develop policies and standards, the office of the CDO should create an enterprise data council or enterprise data committee. This group should be chaired by the CDO and should comprise leaders from all major BUs and corporate functions. The requirements outlined in the policy should be approved by the enterprise data council/committee, published to the organization, and adopted by the BUs and corporate functions. Any tooling required to enable policy compliance should also be centrally maintained by the office of the CDO. Any policy exceptions or violations should be transparently monitored and reported to the respective BU or corporate function head, as well as to the CDO and the enterprise <span class="No-Break">data council/committee.</span></p>
			<h3>Semi-Federated data office model – BUs and corporate functions</h3>
			<p>As BUs and corporate functions establish<a id="_idIndexMarker154"/> leaders to be accountable for policy and standard implementation within their divisions, each application, data asset, and service should be classified against the data domain model. The data domain model establishes a data steward for that asset, application, and/or service. The data steward is ultimately responsible for ensuring that asset, application, and/or service is managed in compliance with policies and standards set forth by the office of the CDO through the enterprise data council/committee and that the assets, applications, and/or <a id="_idIndexMarker155"/>services are used appropriately for their <span class="No-Break">intended use:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer023" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/3.2.jpg" alt="Figure 3.2 – BUs and corporate functions’ responsibilities in the semi-federated model"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.2 – BUs and corporate functions’ responsibilities in the semi-federated model</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-66"><a id="_idTextAnchor065"/>Maturing and empowering through the hub and spoke model</h2>
			<p>A second model, the hub and spoke model, is designed such that the implementation of policies and standards may be through <a id="_idIndexMarker156"/>what is referred to as a hub and spoke model, whereas the central group <a id="_idIndexMarker157"/>provides the expectations, policies standards, <em class="italic">and capabilities</em>, and the spokes (the BUs and corporate functions) of the hub and spoke model drive the implementation down into the depths of the organization. Certainly, there are considerations for the type of business you’re in, the regulations you may need to adhere to, as well as the size and complexity of <span class="No-Break">your organization.</span></p>
			<h3>Hub and spoke model – Office of the CDO</h3>
			<p>The primary difference between the hub <a id="_idIndexMarker158"/>and spoke model and the federated model is that implementation activities fall firmly on the spokes or BUs and corporate functions in this model. In this model, each BU or corporate function may also have a divisional CDO, as with the federated model. While seemingly one significant difference exists in the federated model versus the hub and spoke model, this difference is <em class="italic">significant </em>because the heavy lifting of data governance is not in defining what needs to be done but actually in delivering capabilities to the business via the adoption of central capabilities by the business. The major benefit of the hub and spoke model is the <a id="_idIndexMarker159"/>standardization of capabilities across the organization, which enables consistency across <span class="No-Break">the company:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer024" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/3.3.jpg" alt="Figure 3.3 – Office of the CDO in the hub and spoke model"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.3 – Office of the CDO in the hub and spoke model</p>
			<h3>Hub and spoke model – BUs and corporate functions</h3>
			<p>This model shows how the <a id="_idIndexMarker160"/>BU or Corporate Functions should <span class="No-Break">be designed:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer025" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/3.4.jpg" alt="Figure 3.4 – BUs and corporate functions in the hub and spoke model"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.4 – BUs and corporate functions in the hub and spoke model</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-67"><a id="_idTextAnchor066"/>Driving consistency through the centralized model</h2>
			<p>In the centralized model, all responsibilities sit within the office of the CDO. This model is effective when there are large<a id="_idIndexMarker161"/> disparities between maturity across the organization, there are significant issues <a id="_idIndexMarker162"/>that require remediation, or the company is seeking to maximize consistency or cost savings in the short term. If your organization finds itself fully centralizing data and analytics, I urge you to advocate for this to be a short-term (12-24 months) solution, with the goal of moving to a hub and spoke model upon immediate remediation efforts being achieved. Long-term, the fully centralized model separates data stewards from their BUs and corporate functions, which erodes subject-matter expertise and decreases the effectiveness of the data steward <span class="No-Break">over time.</span></p>
			<p>Ideally, when centralizing, this allows all BUs and corporate functions to come together to take advantage of one another’s expertise, rapidly adopt the capabilities enabled through the office of the CDO, and then push back out to the spokes of the hub and spoke model to manage <a id="_idIndexMarker163"/>data optimally across the <span class="No-Break">organization long-term.</span></p>
			<h3>Centralized model – office of the CDO</h3>
			<p>The following diagram shows<a id="_idIndexMarker164"/> how the Office of the Chief Data Officer could be designed for a <span class="No-Break">Centralized Model:</span></p>
			<div>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-68"><a id="_idTextAnchor067"/>How to select the right model for your organization</h2>
			<p>I have had the opportunity to <a id="_idIndexMarker165"/>drive data transformation within three <em class="italic">Fortune 500</em> organizations (to date), and I can confidently say this: no company manages data perfectly. While some do a better job than others, ultimately, the best model is the model that drives progress, maturity, and overall usage of insights to run your company <span class="No-Break">or organization.</span></p>
			<p>In my experience, companies usually try a few models (if not all of them) over time, until they find one that works well for their situation and/or corporate culture. If your company has yet to establish <em class="italic">any</em> data requirements or capabilities, I recommend starting with establishing an office of the CDO with a small starter team to first build the business case for data (see <a href="B18846_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor041"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">How to Build a Coalition of Advocates</em> for a deeper focus on building the case for data) and working toward the hub and spoke model over time, as functions buy into the outcomes for <span class="No-Break">data maturity.</span></p>
			<p>However, if your organization<a id="_idIndexMarker166"/> has some capabilities that are inconsistently implemented <em class="italic">and</em> you have major issues either with data quality, the appropriate use of data, or trust in your data insights, it may make sense to bring your data and analytics professionals together into a central team to drive consistency, rigor, and improve trust in your data function, capabilities, <span class="No-Break">and output.</span></p>
			<p>Lastly, if you have general <a id="_idIndexMarker167"/>support for your data initiative, strong leaders embedded in the BUs and corporate functions, and are looking to lift overall maturity, adoption of capabilities, or further strengthen the current state, the hub and spoke model is your best option. In my experience, the hub and spoke model is the strongest for lasting success <em class="italic">when, and only when</em> the central office of the CDO is also strong, well established, and appropriately funded (meaning staffing, <span class="No-Break">tools, capabilities).</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-69"><a id="_idTextAnchor068"/>What roles are needed</h1>
			<p>The roles needed in an office of the CDO vary depending on the size and complexity of the organization. The CDO plays a critical role in helping organizations make better decisions by providing them with access to high-quality data. They also help organizations to comply with data privacy regulations. Therefore, the first role we will establish and define is that of CDO. The CDO is unlikely to be the first hire for data in <span class="No-Break">an organization.</span></p>
			<p>Most often, there are<a id="_idIndexMarker168"/> team members who exist and may even be excelling prior to the hiring or establishment of the CDO. Usually, some kind of organizational moment (a crisis, a need to make a shift toward using data, a realization that the company is failing to make timely decisions) has happened, which drives the hiring of a data executive. There are usually data professionals in a company ahead of this hire. They usually are not organized in a central function, or they are centralized but with lower-level professionals. As we structure the function, I am going to start top-down in defining the roles and structures of this function and begin with the CDO, but recognize they are often not the first role <span class="No-Break">that exists.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-70"><a id="_idTextAnchor069"/>CDO versus CDAO</h2>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">CDO</strong> is ultimately <a id="_idIndexMarker169"/>accountable for the success or failure of the company’s use of data. The<a id="_idIndexMarker170"/> responsibility is distributed, but ultimately, the CDO is the<a id="_idIndexMarker171"/> individual who sets the vision, mission, and objectives for success in using and protecting data, as well as steering the company’s data initiatives. Successful CDOs are true partners to the business, understand their needs and strategies, and enable their business partners with solutions that add measurable value to <span class="No-Break">their success.</span></p>
			<p>At the time of this writing, most industries now have an established CDO. What varies is the scope of this role. To help you get started in either agreeing to the scope of your role as the leader of a data<a id="_idIndexMarker172"/> function or to help you write a job description for your organization’s CDO, I have shared a summary that you can start with and customize as you <span class="No-Break">see fit.</span></p>
			<p>The key is to ensure<a id="_idIndexMarker173"/> that the individual hired for this role can navigate the C-suite, create value from data exploitation, and enable business outcomes through data solutions. While<a id="_idIndexMarker174"/> some companies do not use the “chief” designation in the title of the role, I strongly believe it does matter, as it brings credibility to the rest of the C-level employees as a critical executive in <span class="No-Break">the company.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Summary of CDO role</p>
			<p class="callout">The CDO will oversee the management of their information assets, with a focus on establishing and ensuring adherence <a id="_idIndexMarker175"/>to a framework of data governance policies, standards, and practices, both at an enterprise and group level, with a goal of achieving a desired level of consistency and quality commensurate with business needs and outcomes. This individual should possess a balance of technical skills, business acumen, and people skills to navigate the technical and political hurdles of managing valuable corporate <span class="No-Break">data assets.</span></p>
			<p class="callout">Key responsibilities are <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.6 – Organizational model for CDO</p>
			<p>Some organizations refer to their top data leader as a <strong class="bold">CDAO</strong>. Sometimes this is synonymous with CDO, and sometimes it is not. A CDO in one organization may be responsible for both data management and data analytics, whereas, in other organizations, a CDO may only have responsibilities for data management. I have been a CDO in both definitions. Less<a id="_idIndexMarker179"/> commonly, a <strong class="bold">chief analytics officer</strong> (<strong class="bold">CAO</strong>) may also be established. The title<a id="_idIndexMarker180"/> is less important between CDO or CDAO than a definition and clarity of the responsibilities of the role. What’s important is to know in terms of what your organization refers to as the top data leader is what their scope of responsibility includes and that BUs and corporate functions are aligned. For the purposes of this book, I will use CDO to refer to an organization where analytics is <em class="italic">not</em> a part of the organization and CDAO to refer to an organization where analytics <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">is</em></span><span class="No-Break"> included.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Summary of CDAO role</p>
			<p class="callout">The company is seeking an experienced CDAO to lead the company’s data and analytics vision and strategy. In this role, you will be responsible for assessing the current state of the company’s data and <a id="_idIndexMarker181"/>analytics ecosystem, collaborating with both business and technical leaders to design and implement a truly best-in-class strategy that will support the company’s near- and <span class="No-Break">long-term vision.</span></p>
			<p class="callout">You will build and lead a centralized data and analytics team focused on governance, data management, analytics, and <span class="No-Break">data science.</span></p>
			<p class="callout">Responsibilities include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li class="callout">Establishing data and analytics as a first-class, standalone function (for <span class="No-Break">example, centralized)</span></li>
				<li class="callout">Defining the overall data and analytics vision and strategy for <span class="No-Break">the company</span></li>
				<li class="callout">Together, with functional and business leaders, communicate the data strategy and North Star architecture, data infrastructure, and tooling for the organization <span class="No-Break">at large</span></li>

			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-71"><a id="_idTextAnchor070"/>Data management roles</h2>
			<p>For the <strong class="bold">data management</strong> portion of the CDO/CDAO Office, there are four core sub-functions I recommend: data governance, data solutions, data engineering/architecture, and data operations. You<a id="_idIndexMarker183"/> may also want to<a id="_idIndexMarker184"/> supplement your leadership team with roles such as deputy CDO (exactly what it sounds like), chief of staff, and/or program manager. Depending on the size of your company and your team, you may have other roles you need to add as well. Let this be a suggested set of functions but not a comprehensive list. You may need specialized leaders based on your <span class="No-Break">industry needs.</span></p>
			<p>The most important hire when establishing a<a id="_idIndexMarker185"/> data function, and often underappreciated, is the <strong class="bold">data governance and strategy leader</strong>. This leader will be responsible for bringing together the critical mass of data professionals across your organization, defining the company strategy alongside the CDO, and be the individual principally responsible for rolling it out across the organization. This leader will also build out a team that will be responsible for managing the enterprise data council/committee and communities of practice, driving data literacy programs, and monitoring compliance with the policies and standards they will set for the company. Without this person in place, it will be extremely difficult to set expectations for the company to measure. In <a href="B18846_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor087"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Baseline the Organisation</em> we will talk more about how to measure maturity, and ideally, the data governance and strategy leader will also measure the maturity of the organization, and you will need them in place to execute the content outlined in <a href="B18846_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor087"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Baseline </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">the Organisation</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-72"><a id="_idTextAnchor071"/>Data solutions leader</h2>
			<p>The second hire I would<a id="_idIndexMarker188"/> recommend is the <strong class="bold">data solutions leader</strong>. This leader may also be called a data management solutions leader, data enablement leader, or something similar. The<a id="_idIndexMarker189"/> role may also be split across roles such as metadata leader, data quality leader, and master data leader. This leader and/or sub-function is responsible for enablement of data capabilities for the company. They should set the requirements for the capability, work with the IT department to select the proper tooling for your company’s needs, and work with BUs and corporate functions to use the tooling in alignment with policy and standards set by the office of the CDO. The leader will also ensure that the office of the CDO uses these capabilities properly for any data that it is directly accountable for (that is, what’s commonly known <a id="_idIndexMarker190"/>as master data; more on<a id="_idIndexMarker191"/> that in <a href="B18846_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor206"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Master </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Data Management</em></span><span class="No-Break">).</span></p>

			<h3>Information architect</h3>
			<p>The third hire I recommend is an <strong class="bold">information architect</strong>. The information architect is responsible for providing the <a id="_idIndexMarker192"/>company with accessible information. Ideally, this individual will design the way in which information is available for consumption through the architectural design of systems, solutions, and insights. This role is most effective when brought into the<a id="_idIndexMarker193"/> early stages of major programs, to ensure the company’s data needs are designed as an equal capability to process, finance, and so on. Often, data isn’t included until the later stages of major programs, which makes the opportunity to enable the company through transformation harder. Your broader <strong class="bold">data architecture </strong>team will also play a key role in designing data movement across the organization to ensure data flows are optimized and support <a id="_idIndexMarker194"/>the broad needs of <span class="No-Break">the company.</span></p>

			<h3>Data engineering leader</h3>
			<p>As you are hiring the roles outlined previously, as a priority, it would be useful to begin hiring or centralizing <strong class="bold">data engineering</strong> professionals. Data <a id="_idIndexMarker196"/>engineers are often a bit easier to hire compared to the aforementioned roles; however, there is still fierce competition for excellent data engineers, especially with specific skill sets in emerging technologies or niche<a id="_idIndexMarker197"/> areas such as master data, where there is a shortage of deeply experienced talent. Data engineers are responsible for engineering solutions within your data team and for use across the company. Your data engineering team may also create curated and trusted datasets or views that can be consumed across the company. Often, data engineers are responsible for building APIs, data exchanges, and broadly moving data across <span class="No-Break">your organization.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Summary of a data engineering leader</p>
			<p class="callout">The data engineering leader will deliver data engineering capabilities for the company.

			<h3>Data operations leader</h3>
			<p>Finally, the <strong class="bold">data operations</strong> team is responsible for running day-to-day operations within the team and may be responsible for managing errors, manual movement, or matching of anomaly data <a id="_idIndexMarker199"/>or unmatched records in your master data platform. Ideally, the data operations team may also cover data remediation, which<a id="_idIndexMarker200"/> is the correcting of data issues. In many data transformations, there are times when data must be remediated in larger batches or groups to prepare for data migrations to new platforms. The data operations team can provide this service for <span class="No-Break">the company.</span></p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-73"><a id="_idTextAnchor072"/>AI considerations</h1>
			<p>At the time of this writing, AI has become the topic of almost any conversation related to data. Most data practitioners, like myself, are excited about the potential that AI has to offer but also want to see governance applied to AI practices. Data professionals are in higher demand than ever due to the data governance needs to support AI. The top questions include <span class="No-Break">the</span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker203"/></span><span class="No-Break"> following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>How do I ensure that the underlying data set used to train AI <span class="No-Break">is appropriate?</span></li>
				<li>How are prompts protected? Are <span class="No-Break">they retained?</span></li>
				<li>How do we protect <strong class="bold">intellectual property</strong> (<strong class="bold">IP</strong>; for example, source code) if entered into an <a id="_idIndexMarker204"/>open source <span class="No-Break">AI solution?</span></li>
				<li>How is my <span class="No-Break">data protected?</span></li>
				<li>How are GenAI products being trained? What happens to <span class="No-Break">the data?</span></li>
				<li>How do we ensure that input and output are handled ethically and in accordance with our <span class="No-Break">company values?</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>There is so much to be defined around AI, and the pace of change is only increasing. Many organizations are looking to their CDO to help define what they should do to establish appropriate practices around <a id="_idIndexMarker205"/>data use in AI and <strong class="bold">machine learning</strong> (<strong class="bold">ML</strong>). It is appropriate for you, as the data leader for your organization, to be responsible, and urgent for you to prioritize this area. With the expectation of oversight on the horizon by regulators across the globe, it’s critical that data leaders are a part of ensuring the company defines governance and ethical use practices for how data is used for <a id="_idIndexMarker206"/>ML and, specifically, for <strong class="bold">large language models</strong> (<strong class="bold">LLMs</strong>) to be defined as <span class="No-Break">a priority.</span></p>
			<p>On the other hand, you may also consider how you might use AI to drive excellence in your data solutions. This topic is complex and emerging rapidly. I encourage you to look into these areas as new<a id="_idIndexMarker207"/> opportunities to leverage AI emerge. Key areas to consider are <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data quality</strong>: AI can be used to<a id="_idIndexMarker208"/> improve data quality by identifying and correcting errors, inconsistencies, and missing values. This can help to ensure that data is accurate and reliable <span class="No-Break">for decision-making.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data privacy</strong>: AI can be used to protect <a id="_idIndexMarker209"/>data privacy by anonymizing or pseudonymizing data and by implementing access controls. This can help to ensure that data is not misused or disclosed to <span class="No-Break">unauthorized individuals.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data security</strong>: AI can be used to protect data security by detecting and preventing cyberattacks and<a id="_idIndexMarker210"/> by implementing data encryption. This can help to ensure that data is not lost, stolen, <span class="No-Break">or corrupted.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data compliance</strong>: AI can be used to <a id="_idIndexMarker211"/>ensure data compliance with regulations by identifying and remediating compliance risks. This can help to ensure that organizations comply with applicable laws <span class="No-Break">and regulations.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>It is important to note that AI is a rapidly evolving field, and the considerations for AI in a data governance team will continue to change as AI <span class="No-Break">technologies develop.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-74"><a id="_idTextAnchor073"/>How to structure the team for results (and why)</h1>
			<p>While we are focused on the<a id="_idIndexMarker212"/> data governance and data management portions of the team in this book, I do want to spend just a moment on the analytics side of the team structure. Candidly, I believe there are an infinite number of ways to structure the analytics side of the house, as you can read further in John K. Thompson’s book, <em class="italic">Building Analytics Teams</em> (an excellent book for anyone looking to drive excellence in analytics). There are a few ways to optimize analytics that I have leveraged in my own teams. In all cases, it is based on the business outcome I have been aiming to <span class="No-Break">optimize for.</span></p>
			<p>First, if you are internally focused, aimed at driving operational excellence, aligning top-of-the-house metrics, or simply supporting internal operational functions, a simple single team may be your best bet. I have consolidated analytics teams under a single analytics leader in cases where we are optimizing for the company’s internal needs. Second, if you are focused on improving products and engineering therein, I would recommend aligning the analytics teams by BU. For example, if you have a software and a hardware BU, divide your analytics team into a software analytics team and a hardware analytics team. The upside is your teams are now intensely focused and aligned with the business area they support, learn the drivers deeply, and can optimize for their stakeholders. The downside is you must personally be the connective tissue across these two teams and ensure alignment, as well as where the two teams need to come together <span class="No-Break">for success.</span></p>
			<p>Alternatively, depending on your business, you may also be intensely focused on the customer (and I hope that you are, regardless of business). This focus on external stakeholders (marketing, sales, customer success) may result in individual analytics teams for sales, marketing, and CXS, or a single team focused on customer analytics. In all cases, you should optimize for the outcomes you are aiming to solve and not be afraid to adjust as your <a id="_idIndexMarker213"/>priorities change. When you stand up your team, you may have burning needs that must be addressed urgently; optimize for those by structuring your team accordingly. However, as you mature your function, do not hesitate to adjust. The one constant, after all, <span class="No-Break">is change.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-75"><a id="_idTextAnchor074"/>Building the rhythm of the business of data</h1>
			<p>As you organize your team, another priority you must address early on is establishing the rhythm of the business of data. In all of the data programs I have led, I have underappreciated the importance of this early on and have had to learn from the consequences. While you are <a id="_idIndexMarker214"/>coming into your role and listening to the business, your team, and working on your strategy, your team is still working on…something. It is critical that you get your arms around what is happening within your team while you are working with your peers and senior executives to understand the priorities of the company and for the future of <span class="No-Break">your team.</span></p>
			<p>I recommend assigning someone on the team the task <a id="_idIndexMarker215"/>of building an inventory of the programs, projects, and <strong class="bold">business-as-usual</strong> (<strong class="bold">BAU</strong>) work that is occurring across your organization. A program leader or chief of staff is a great person to tap into to lead this effort. In my experience, program management is often not the priority of data leaders, and thus, I have yet to step into a data leadership role where this existed clearly and comprehensively. If you have this in your team, you are off to a great start. If you don’t, get to work on identifying what the team is working on, and do it quickly. The sooner you can get your arms around the outcomes the team is already working on, the sooner you can identify quick wins and optimize the team <span class="No-Break">for success.</span></p>
			<p>As a part of this program management exercise, I recommend you set up a routine forum to review the business of data portfolio. You should ideally be getting regular updates on what the team is working on, progress made, stakeholder results (<em class="italic">note</em>: not data results, but what the<a id="_idIndexMarker216"/> stakeholders you serve are experiencing from the work of your team), issues and risks, and upcoming milestones. Does the team need your support to move forward? Are there barriers to success? This insight will also help arm you headed into executive stakeholder meetings so that you are not caught off guard as you are working to form relationships. You may want to establish a business of data program review for this purpose, on at least a bi-weekly basis. As you are getting up to speed in your role, you may ask each of your direct reports to set up a time to brief you more comprehensively on their portions of the program so that you can get a deeper dive before moving into the regular routine <span class="No-Break">of review.</span></p>
			<p>As you start to bring together key leaders across the organization, to manage data (as a team sport for the company), you should establish a few forums to continue to keep the key stakeholders actively engaged for the purposes of supporting data outcomes for the company. You will end up with a few different forums to do so, and I will provide a sample charter for each that you can leverage to <span class="No-Break">get started.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-76"><a id="_idTextAnchor075"/>Enterprise data committee</h2>
			<p>As you begin to engage with <a id="_idIndexMarker217"/>executive peers, invite them to join <a id="_idIndexMarker218"/>you in the <strong class="bold">enterprise data council</strong> or committee. As discussed in <a href="B18846_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">What is Data Governance?</em> and <a href="B18846_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor041"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">How to Build a Coalition of Advocates</em> this forum serves as the uniting function for your data domain executives. This forum also serves as a great place to prioritize initiatives, ensure<a id="_idIndexMarker219"/> the right funding is allocated to the right data programs, and ensure that issues that arise have the appropriate visibility and prioritization for remediation by your data operations team or data leaders across the company as appropriate. This group should influence and approve the company’s data strategy and corresponding transformation. A curated summary of the business of data program may be a useful view to share with the council <a id="_idIndexMarker220"/>either as an appendix to materials or shared in <span class="No-Break">offline updates.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Sample charter for enterprise data committee</p>
			<p class="callout"><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Purpose</strong></span></p>
			<p class="callout">The data governance committee is responsible for developing and implementing a data governance framework for the organization. This framework will ensure that data is managed effectively and responsibly and that it is used to support the organization’s <span class="No-Break">strategic goals.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading"><strong class="bold">Importance</strong></p>
			<p class="callout">A data governance framework is important for several reasons. First, it helps to ensure that data is accurate, complete, and consistent. Second, it helps to protect data from unauthorized access, use, or <a id="_idIndexMarker221"/>disclosure. Third, it helps to ensure that data is used in a way that is compliant with laws and regulations. Fourth, it helps to improve the quality of decision-making by providing access to reliable and <span class="No-Break">relevant data.</span></p>
			<p class="callout"><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Key representatives</strong></span></p>
			<p class="callout">The data governance committee should include executives (C-suite leaders) from all areas of the organization that use data, including <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li class="callout"><span class="No-Break">Information technology</span></li>
				<li class="callout"><span class="No-Break">BUs</span></li>

			</ul>
			<p class="callout"><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Communication plan</strong></span></p>
			<p class="callout">The data governance committee will communicate with employees through a variety of channels, including <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>

			</ul>
			<p class="callout-heading"><strong class="bold">Evaluation plan</strong></p>
			<p class="callout">The data governance committee will evaluate the effectiveness of the data governance framework on an <span class="No-Break">annual basis.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-77"><a id="_idTextAnchor076"/>Enterprise data council</h2>
			<p>The council can be a <a id="_idIndexMarker223"/>forum ahead of vetting and reporting out to the C-suite in your organization. While some members of the C-suite may sit on your enterprise data council, others likely do not. Thus, ensuring that the right information is shared with <a id="_idIndexMarker224"/>the right individuals is a key component of your communication plan. Previewing information for the C-suite with the council is helpful in that: you can obtain feedback from the council ahead of presenting the C-suite, and, you can task council members with garnering support for your enterprise programs with their managers, often on <span class="No-Break">the C-suite.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Sample charter for enterprise data council</p>
			<p class="callout"><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Purpose</strong></span></p>
			<p class="callout">The data governance council is a cross-functional group of senior leaders responsible for setting the strategic direction and overseeing the implementation of data governance at <em class="italic">organization name</em>. The council will develop and implement policies and procedures to ensure the effective management of data across <span class="No-Break">the organization.</span></p>
			<p class="callout"><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Importance</strong></span></p>
			<p class="callout">Data is a critical asset for <em class="italic">organization name</em>. It is used to make decisions, develop products and services, and improve operations. Effective data governance is essential to ensure that data is used in a responsible and ethical manner and that it is protected from unauthorized access <span class="No-Break">and disclosure.</span></p>
			<p class="callout"><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Key representatives</strong></span></p>
			<p class="callout">The data governance council will include representatives from the following departments, typically 1-2 levels below the C-suite member they support on the data <span class="No-Break">governance committee:</span></p>

			</ul>
			<p class="callout-heading"><strong class="bold">Key roles and responsibilities</strong></p>
			<p class="callout">The data governance council will have the following key roles <span class="No-Break">and responsibilities:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li class="callout">Developing and implementing data governance policies <span class="No-Break">and procedures</span></li>

			<p class="callout"><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Reporting structure</strong></span></p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-78"><a id="_idTextAnchor077"/>Functional roles</h1>
			<p>Functional data roles are the people within a BU or corporate function who are responsible for managing <a id="_idIndexMarker228"/>and using data. They include the typically thought-of roles of data analysts, data scientists, data engineers, and data architects. They also include governance roles that define data accountability, such as business data stewards, technical data stewards, and data <span class="No-Break">operations leaders.</span></p>
			<p>Functional data roles are essential for any organization that wants to make effective use of data. They help businesses to understand their data, identify trends, and make <span class="No-Break">better decisions.</span></p>
			<p>In a large organization, there may be multiple functional data roles within each BU or corporate function. The specific roles and responsibilities of functional data roles will vary depending on the organization and the industry. However, all functional data roles share a common goal of using data to help the organization achieve its goals. Functional data roles are a critical part of any organization that wants to be successful in the digital age. By using data effectively, organizations can improve their decision-making, increase their efficiency, and create a <span class="No-Break">competitive advantage.</span></p>
			<p>For every data domain (the logical grouping of like data; for example, sales, marketing, product, and human resources), accountability should be defined in three <span class="No-Break">key ways:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Executive accountability through an <em class="italic">executive data </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">domain leader</em></span></li>
				<li>Business of data accountability through a <em class="italic">business </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">data steward</em></span></li>
				<li>Technical data accountability through a <em class="italic">technical </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">data steward</em></span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>You may have noticed I did not say “owner” and instead used “accountability.” Utilizing terms such as “data trustee” or “steward” drives behaviors that the individual named is simply accountable for ensuring the data is cared for appropriately for the use of others. This is a very different mindset than that of “ownership,” which implies an environment where there is no sharing. The sole purpose of data management is to care for data and to use it for its intended<a id="_idIndexMarker229"/> value. Ownership creates barriers to achieving this purpose and thus is not recommended. Data is an enterprise asset and should be treated as such. The stewards are in place to ensure it can be used as just that—for <span class="No-Break">the enterprise.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-79"><a id="_idTextAnchor078"/>Executive data domain leader</h2>
			<p>An executive data domain<a id="_idIndexMarker230"/> leader is a senior executive, often a C-suite member for medium-sized organizations, or, in larger organizations, a -1 from the C-suite, who is ultimately accountable for ensuring that data within their data domain is managed appropriately, that the team complies with the expectations of the CDO, including the data strategy, data policies and procedures, and any supporting frameworks. They are also responsible for data sponsorship within their domain and ensuring funding is appropriately secured for <span class="No-Break">domain-specific work.</span></p>
			<p>The executive data domain leader is responsible for appointing business data stewards and technical data stewards to manage the day-to-day care of data assets in <span class="No-Break">their domain.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-80"><a id="_idTextAnchor079"/>Business data steward</h2>
			<p>A business data steward is <a id="_idIndexMarker231"/>responsible for ensuring the quality, accuracy, and consistency of data used by a business. They work with business users to understand their data needs and then develop and implement data governance policies and procedures. They also monitor data quality and identify and correct <span class="No-Break">any issues.</span></p>
			<p>These leaders are often in BUs and/or data domains and may be responsible for a large quantity of data assets or just a few. While a data domain must have at least one business data steward, they often <span class="No-Break">have many.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-81"><a id="_idTextAnchor080"/>Technical data steward</h2>
			<p>A technical data steward is responsible for the technical aspects of data management, such as data modeling, data<a id="_idIndexMarker232"/> warehousing, and data integration. They work with IT professionals to develop and implement data management solutions. They also monitor data quality and identify and correct any issues. These leaders are often in the technology department and/or within business IT functions and may be responsible for a large quantity of data domains or just one. While a data domain must have at least one technical data steward, they could have many. The variance comes down to the size and complexity of your <span class="No-Break">respective company.</span></p>
			<p>In short, a business data steward focuses on the business side of data management, while a technical data steward focuses on the technical side. However, they are close partners and should work as such to ensure data is managed well as an <span class="No-Break">enterprise asset.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-82"><a id="_idTextAnchor081"/>Talent development</h1>
			<p>Finally, the last, yet critical component of building a high-performing data practice at your company is managing talent. I would be remiss not to take a moment to discuss how to manage data talent effectively. In all of my various data roles, there has been some level of challenge in finding and <a id="_idIndexMarker233"/>recruiting the best possible talent. Nearly every company is hiring data talent, and thus, ensuring that you are both hiring for your near-term needs while also ensuring you are building a talent pipeline for the long term is equally <span class="No-Break">as important.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-83"><a id="_idTextAnchor082"/>Recruiting talent</h2>
			<p>As a leader, one of the<a id="_idIndexMarker234"/> best ways I’ve found to recruit talent is to be visible. By engaging in public speaking opportunities at local universities, mentoring high school students, and/or participating in local technology organizations, you can get to know the talent emerging in your market. You and your leadership team should be aware of high-quality emerging talent before you need them. Be mindful of the schools and organizations you work with so that you can ensure you are looking at talent from a broad and diverse perspective. Offering internships is a great way to work with emerging talent ahead of hiring the <span class="No-Break">individual full-time.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-84"><a id="_idTextAnchor083"/>Growing the pipeline of talent</h2>
			<p>There are non-traditional ways to grow your data talent pipeline that I have also had success with. First, consider rotations within your team across disciplines, but also with the business. Consider rotating your team members out into the businesses they support (along with someone from the business coming into your team) for a period of time agreed to with the<a id="_idIndexMarker235"/> business. Do you risk losing your team members permanently in the business? Yes – however, this may also place more data-literate individuals into the business who can become champions for your team and the work you do. This is still a good outcome if you allow it to be. Ideally, that individual comes back to your team with a renewed perspective of the business <span class="No-Break">they support.</span></p>
			<p>I also urge you to think about your hiring criteria. For all roles, do you <em class="italic">really</em> need a 4-year college degree to qualify? Or is 4 years of on-the-job training sufficient? What about a 2-year associate’s degree? Do you accept certifications? What is it that you are attempting to obtain from a skills perspective from the requirements you outline? I am not discounting a college education; however, there may be roles where you can widen your aperture and tap into an entirely new population of candidates that you would not otherwise <span class="No-Break">have considered.</span></p>
			<p>Hiring related or adjacent roles is also a great way to widen your hiring options. For example, the business of data program leader defined previously could be hired and trained from your company’s <strong class="bold">project management office</strong> (<strong class="bold">PMO</strong>). Perhaps they have been exposed to your team <a id="_idIndexMarker236"/>and could bring rigor from the PMO team to your organization. Overall, thinking beyond traditional hiring criteria may create a more diverse, innovative, and deeper talent pool than you may have <span class="No-Break">originally considered.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-85"><a id="_idTextAnchor084"/>Upskilling and reskilling</h2>
			<p>Lastly, as you consider implementing new technologies or designing new solutions, be thinking about how you might need to upskill or reskill your team. While supplementing your team members with<a id="_idIndexMarker237"/> experts in new technologies or solutions may be<a id="_idIndexMarker238"/> helpful, do not discount the desire of well-motivated team members to learn new things. I’ve seen data professionals replace entire teams of people upon migration to new technologies, which has led to enormous disruption of the business and a loss of institutional knowledge. Be open-minded and creative in how you solve your <span class="No-Break">talent gaps.</span></p>
			<p>This chapter contained plentiful considerations for how to structure the team, the key roles you might need, and how to manage talent acquisition/development. Arguably there are endless combinations and<a id="_idIndexMarker239"/> role combinations to consider. Ultimately, you can structure the team the way <a id="_idIndexMarker240"/>you prefer; however, if nothing else, consider the outcomes you are working toward. Ensure you have the closest distance between the hardest problems and yourself so that you can focus on the priorities of <span class="No-Break">the company.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-86"><a id="_idTextAnchor085"/>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>As you set out to establish the appropriate structure for your team, remember – perfection is not the goal. Get started. If you need to make changes over time, especially as your company’s data management capabilities mature, you will need to adjust as you go. Don’t be afraid to do that. I have found it is effective to set expectations with the team that you may need to evolve. The one constant is change, and with success will come the need to change, add team members, optimize, and restructure, and that’s a good thing. It means that you are making an impact. Pick the right model for you, adjust it for your company’s unique needs, and get going. The faster you make changes, based on the right information, the better off your team members will be, and the sooner they can focus <span class="No-Break">on delivery.</span></p>
