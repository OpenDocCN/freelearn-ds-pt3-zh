- en: We are becoming awash in the flood of digital data from scientific research,
    engineering, economics, politics, journalism, business, and many other domains.
    As a result, analyzing, visualizing, and harnessing data is the occupation of
    an increasingly large and diverse set of people. Quantitative skills such as programming,
    numerical computing, mathematics, statistics, and data mining, which form the
    core of data science, are more and more appreciated in a seemingly endless plethora
    of fields.

- en: My previous book, *Learning IPython for Interactive Computing and Data Visualization*,
    *Packt Publishing*, published in 2013, was a beginner-level introduction to data
    science and numerical computing with Python. This widely-used programming language
    is also one of the most popular platforms for these disciplines.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book continues that journey by presenting more than 100 advanced recipes
    for data science and mathematical modeling. These recipes not only cover programming
    and computing topics such as interactive computing, numerical computing, high-performance
    computing, parallel computing, and interactive visualization, but also data analysis
    topics such as statistics, data mining, machine learning, signal processing, and
    many others.

- en: All of this book's code has been written in the IPython notebook. IPython is
    at the heart of the Python data analysis platform. Originally created to enhance
    the default Python console, IPython is now mostly known for its widely acclaimed
    notebook. This web-based interactive computational environment combines code,
    rich text, images, mathematical equations, and plots into a single document. It
    is an ideal gateway to data analysis and high-performance numerical computing
    in Python.

    distribution ([http://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/](http://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/)).
    This Python distribution contains most of the packages that we will be using in
    this book. It also includes a powerful packaging system named conda. The book's
    website contains all the instructions to install Anaconda and run the code examples.
    You should learn how to install packages (`conda install packagename`) and how
    to create multiple Python environments with conda.

    has been tested on Python 3.4.1, Anaconda 2.0.1, Windows 8.1 64-bit, although
    it definitely works on Linux and Mac OS X), but it also works with Python 2.7\.
    We mention any compatibility issue when required. These issues are rare in this
    book, because NumPy does the heavy lifting in most cases. NumPy's interface hasn't
    changed between Python 2 and Python 3.

    You should only pick Python 2 if you really need to (for example, if you absolutely
    need a Python package that doesn't support Python 3, or if part of your user base
    is stuck with Python 2). We cover this question in greater detail in [Chapter
    2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Best Practices in Interactive Computing"), *Best Practices
    in Interactive Computing*.
