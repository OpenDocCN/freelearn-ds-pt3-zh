    <h1 id="_idParaDest-290" class="chapterTitle">Sharing Your Data Story</h1>
    <p class="normal">Throughout this book, we've focused on Tableau Desktop and learned how to visually explore and communicate data with visualizations and dashboards. Once you've made discoveries, designed insightful visualizations, and built stunning dashboards, you're ready to share your data stories.</p>
    <p class="normal">Tableau enables you to share your work using a variety of methods. In this chapter, we'll take a look at the various ways to share visualizations and dashboards, along with what to consider when deciding how you will share your project.</p>
    <p class="normal">Specifically, we'll look at the following topics:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="list">Presenting, printing, and exporting</li>
      <li class="list">Sharing with users of Tableau Desktop and Tableau Reader</li>
      <li class="list">Sharing with users of Tableau Server, Tableau Online, and Tableau Public</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">There are no examples to follow in this chapter, but it is highly recommended to read through the material for a solid understanding of the various options available for sharing your insights and discoveries.</p>
    <p class="normal">Let's start with an overview of the presenting, printing and exporting processes.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-291" class="title">Presenting, printing, and exporting</h1>
    <p class="normal">Tableau is primarily designed to build richly interactive visualizations and dashboards for consumption on a screen. Often, you will expect users to interact with your dashboards and visualizations. However, there are good options for presenting, printing, and exporting in a variety of formats.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-292" class="title">Presenting</h2>
    <p class="normal">Tableau gives you multiple options for personally presenting<a id="_idIndexMarker1295"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1296"/> your data story. You might walk your audience through a presentation of a single dashboard or view, or you might create an entire presentation. While there are multiple ways you might structure a presentation, consider the following options:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="list">Exporting to PowerPoint</li>
      <li class="list">Presentation mode</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Tableau Desktop and Server allow you to<a id="_idIndexMarker1297"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1298"/> export directly to <strong class="bold">PowerPoint</strong>. In Tableau Desktop, select <strong class="screen-text">File</strong> | <strong class="screen-text">Export as PowerPoint...</strong>. After selecting a location and filename, Tableau will generate a PowerPoint file (<code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">.pptx</code>), converting each tab in the Tableau workbook to a single slide in PowerPoint. Each slide will contain a static image of the views and dashboards as they exist at the time of the export. As each slide is simply a screenshot, there will be no dynamic interactivity following the export.</p>
    <p class="normal">If you prefer a more<a id="_idIndexMarker1299"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1300"/> dynamic presentation experience, consider using <strong class="bold">Presentation mode</strong>. This mode shows you all dashboards and views in full screen mode. It hides all toolbars, panes, and authoring objects. To activate presentation mode, select <strong class="screen-text">Window</strong> from the top menu or press <em class="italics">F7</em> or the option on the top toolbar. Press <em class="italics">F7</em> or the <em class="italics">Esc</em> key to exit presentation mode. While in presentation mode, you may still interact with dashboards and views using actions, highlighting, filtering, and other options. This enriches the presentation and gives you the ability to answer questions on the fly. When used with compelling dashboards and stories, presentation mode makes for an effective way to personally walk your audience through the data story.</p>
    <div class="packt_tip">
      <p>If you save a workbook by pressing <kbd class="Key--PACKT-">Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd class="Key--PACKT-">S</kbd> while in presentation mode, the workbook will be opened in presentation mode by default.</p>
    </div>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-293" class="title">Printing</h2>
    <p class="normal">Tableau enables printing<a id="_idIndexMarker1301"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1302"/> for individual visualizations, dashboards, and stories. From the <strong class="screen-text">File</strong> menu, you can select <strong class="screen-text">Print</strong> to send the currently active sheet in the workbook to the printer or the <strong class="screen-text">Print to PDF</strong> option to export to a PDF. Either option allows you to export the active sheet, selected sheets, or the entire workbook to a PDF. To select multiple sheets, hold the <kbd class="Key--PACKT-">Ctrl</kbd> key and click individual tabs.</p>
    <p class="normal">When printing, you also have the option to <strong class="screen-text">Show Selections</strong>. When this option is checked, marks that have been interactively selected or highlighted on a view or dashboard will be printed as selected. Otherwise, marks will print as though no selections have been made. The map in the following dashboard has marks for the western half of the United States selected:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_16_01.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 16.1: You can see states and circles that are selected in this screenshot.You may optionally print views with selections</p>
    <p class="normal">Here are some <a id="_idIndexMarker1303"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1304"/>considerations, tips, and suggestions for printing:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="list">If a dashboard is being designed for printing, select a predefined paper size as the fixed size for the dashboard or use a custom size that matches the same aspect ratio.</li>
      <li class="list">Use the <strong class="screen-text">Page Setup</strong> screen (available from the <strong class="screen-text">File</strong> menu) to define specific print options, such as what elements (legends, title, caption) will be included, the layout (including margins and centering), and how the view or dashboard should be scaled to match the paper size. The <strong class="screen-text">Page Setup</strong> options are specific to each view. Duplicating or copying a sheet will include any changes to the <strong class="screen-text">Page Setup</strong> settings:
    <div class="packt_tip">
      <p>If you are designing multiple sheets or dashboards for printing, consider creating one as a template, setting up all the desired print settings, and then duplicating it for each new sheet.</p>
    </div>
	</li>
    </ul>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_16_02.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 16.2: The Page Setup dialog contains options for layout and print scaling</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="list">Fields used on <a id="_idIndexMarker1305"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1306"/>the <strong class="screen-text">Pages</strong> shelf will define page breaks in printing (for individual sheets, but not dashboards or stories). The number of pages defined by the <strong class="screen-text">Pages</strong> shelf is not necessarily equivalent to the number of printed pages. This is because a single page defined by the <strong class="screen-text">Pages</strong> shelf might require more than one printed page.</li>
      <li class="list">Each story point in a story will be printed on a new page.</li>
      <li class="list">Printing the entire workbook can be an effective way to generate a single PDF document for distribution. Each visible sheet will be included in the PDF in the order of the tabs, from left to right. You may hide sheets to prevent inclusion in the PDF or reorder sheets to adjust the order of the resultant document. Consider also creating dashboards with images and text for title pages, table of contents, page numbers, and commentary. You might experiment with complete workbooks from previous chapters to see how various visual elements are retained or changed in the PDF conversion.</li>
      <li class="list">Avoid scrollbars in dashboards as they will print as scrollbars, and anything outside the visible window will not be printed.</li>
      <li class="list">You can also select multiple sheets in the workbook (hold the <kbd class="Key--PACKT-">Ctrl</kbd> key while clicking each tab) and then<a id="_idIndexMarker1307"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1308"/> print only selected sheets.
    <div class="packt_tip">
      <p>Sheets may be hidden if they are views that are used in one or more dashboards or tooltips, or if they are dashboards used in one or more stories. To hide a view, right-click the tab or thumbnail on the bottom strip or in the left-hand pane of the dashboard or story workspace and select <strong class="screen-text">Hide Sheet</strong>. To show a sheet, locate it in the left-hand pane of the dashboard or story workspace, right-click it, and uncheck <strong class="screen-text">Hide Sheet.</strong> You can also right-click a dashboard or story tab and hide or show all sheets used.</p>
      <p class="Tip-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">If you don't see a <strong class="screen-text">Hide Sheet</strong> option, this means this sheet is not used in any dashboard and can be deleted.</p>
    </div>
</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">In addition to printing or outputting to PDF, we can also export data and images from views and dashboards. Let's see how!</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-294" class="title">Exporting</h2>
    <p class="normal">Tableau also makes<a id="_idIndexMarker1309"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1310"/> it easy to export images of views, dashboards, and stories for use in documents, documentation, and even books like this one! Images may be exported as <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">.png</code>, <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">.emf</code>, <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">.jpg</code>, or <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">.bmp</code>. You may also copy an image to the clipboard to paste into other applications. You may also export the data as a cross-tab (Excel), a <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">.csv</code> file, or Microsoft Access database (on PC).</p>
    <p class="normal">To copy an image or export images or data, use the menu options for <strong class="bold">Worksheet</strong>, <strong class="bold">Dashboard</strong>, or <strong class="bold">Story</strong>.</p>
    <p class="normal">We'll consider using Tableau Server, Tableau Online, and Tableau Public in detail shortly. For now, let's consider some of the exporting features available on these platforms. When interacting with a view on Tableau Server, Online, or Public, you will see a toolbar unless you don't have the required permissions or the toolbar has been specifically disabled by a Tableau Server administrator:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_16_03.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 16.3: Exporting from the toolbar provides a similar experience for Server, Online, and Public</p>
    <p class="normal">The <strong class="screen-text">Download</strong> option<a id="_idIndexMarker1311"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1312"/> from the toolbar allows you to download an <strong class="screen-text">Image</strong>, <strong class="screen-text">Data</strong>, <strong class="screen-text">Crosstab</strong> (Excel), <strong class="screen-text">PDF</strong>, <strong class="screen-text">PowerPoint</strong>, or the <strong class="screen-text">Tableau Workbook</strong>. Images are exported in <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">.png</code> format and render the dashboard in its current state. Exporting a <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">.pdf</code> document will give the user many options, including layout, scaling, and whether to print the current dashboard, all sheets in the workbook, or all sheets in the current dashboard.</p>
    <div class="packt_tip">
      <p>Exporting data or a crosstab will export for the active view in the dashboard; that is, if you click a view in the dashboard, it becomes active and you can export the data or crosstab for that particular view.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">Other options exist for exporting from Tableau Server:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="list">Dashboards with <strong class="screen-text">Export</strong> buttons you may recall the <strong class="screen-text">Export</strong> button as one of the objects available to include on a dashboard. These can be configured to export the entire dashboard as a PDF, PowerPoint, or an image, and are a nice alternative to the toolbar option. This also allows for easy exporting from Tableau Desktop.</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Tabcmd</strong> gives <a id="_idIndexMarker1313"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1314"/>you the ability to export data, images, or documents in a wide variety of formats via the command line or scripts.</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">REST API</strong> gives<a id="_idIndexMarker1315"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1316"/> you the ability to programmatically export data, images, or documents in a wide variety of formats.</li>
      <li class="list">You may append the extension to the URL of a view hosted on Tableau Server or Online to view or download in the format defined by the link. For example, appending <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">.pdf</code> so that the URL would be something like <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">https://tableauserver/#/views/Dashboard/View.pdf</code> would render the view as a PDF document in the browser.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Beyond sharing image or document exports, most often you'll want to share fully interactive dashboards with others. Let's consider how you might accomplish this.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-295" class="title">Sharing with users of Tableau Desktop and Tableau Reader</h1>
    <p class="normal">You may share workbooks with other users of Tableau Desktop and Tableau Reader. We'll consider the options and note some differences in the following sections.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-296" class="title">Sharing with Tableau Desktop users</h2>
    <p class="normal">Sharing a<a id="_idIndexMarker1317"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1318"/> workbook with other Tableau Desktop users is fairly straightforward, but there are a few things to consider.</p>
    <p class="normal">One of the major considerations is whether you will be sharing a packaged workbook (<code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">.twbx</code>) or an unpackaged workbook (<code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">.twb</code>). Packaged workbooks are single files that contain the workbook (<code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">.twb</code>), extracts (<code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">.hyper</code>), file-based data sources that have not been extracted (<code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">.xls</code>, <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">.xlsx</code>, <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">.txt</code>, <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">.cub</code>, <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">.mdb</code>, and others), custom images, and various other related files.</p>
    <p class="normal">To share with users of Tableau Desktop, you have a variety of options:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="list">You may share either a packaged (<code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">.twbx</code>) or unpackaged (<code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">.twb</code>) workbook by simply sharing the file with another user who has the same or a newer version of Tableau Desktop.
    <div class="packt_tip">
      <p>Workbook files will be updated when saved in a newer version of Tableau Desktop. You may receive errors or warnings when you open the workbook in an older version of Tableau. You will be prompted about updates when you first open the workbook and again when you attempt to save it. You may optionally export a workbook as a previous version from the <strong class="screen-text">File</strong> menu.</p>
    </div>
	</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li class="list">If you share an unpackaged (<code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">.twb</code>) workbook, then anyone else using it must be able to access any data sources, and any referenced images must be available to the user in the same directory where the original files were referenced. For example, if the workbook uses a live connection to an Excel (<code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">.xlsx</code>) file on a network path and includes images on a dashboard located in <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">C:\Images</code>, then all users must be able to access the Excel file on the network path and have a local <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">C:\Images</code> directory with image files of the same name.
    <div class="packt_tip">
      <p>Consider using a UNC (for example, <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">\\servername\directory\file.xlsx</code>) path for common files if you use this approach.</p>
    </div>
	</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Similarly, if you<a id="_idIndexMarker1319"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1320"/> share a packaged workbook (<code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">.twbx</code>) that uses live connections, anyone using the workbook must be able to access the live connection data source and have appropriate permissions.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-297" class="title">Sharing with Tableau Reader users</h2>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Tableau Reader</strong> is a free<a id="_idIndexMarker1321"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1322"/> application provided by Tableau Software that allows users to interact with visualizations, dashboards, and stories created in Tableau Desktop. Unlike Tableau Desktop, it does not allow for the authoring of visualizations or dashboards. However, all interactivity, such as filtering, drilldown, actions, and highlighting, is available to the end user.</p>
    <div class="packt_tip">
      <p>Think of Tableau Reader as being similar to many PDF readers that allow you to read and navigate the document, but do not allow for authoring or saving changes.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">To share with users of Tableau Reader, consider the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="list">Reader will only open packaged (<code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">.twbx</code>) workbooks.</li>
      <li class="list">The packaged workbook may not contain live connections to server or cloud-based data sources. Those connections must be extracted.
    <div class="packt_tip">
      <p>Be certain to take into consideration security and confidentiality concerns when sharing packaged workbooks (<code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">.twbx</code>). Since packaged workbooks most often contain the data, you must be certain that the data is not sensitive. Even if the data is not shown on any view or dashboard, if it is a part of an extract or file packaged with the workbook, it is still accessible.</p>
    </div>
	</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Reader and Desktop <a id="_idIndexMarker1323"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1324"/>are good options but do require other users to have the application installed. You might also consider using Tableau Server, Online, or Public to share and collaborate with a wider audience.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-298" class="title">Sharing with users of Tableau Server, Tableau Online, and Tableau Public</h1>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Tableau Server</strong>, <strong class="bold">Tableau Online</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Tableau Public</strong> are all<a id="_idIndexMarker1325"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1326"/> variations on the same concept: hosting<a id="_idIndexMarker1327"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1328"/> visualizations and dashboards on a server and allowing users to<a id="_idIndexMarker1329"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1330"/> access them through a web browser.</p>

    <ul>
      <li class="list">In order to use Tableau Public, you will need to register an account.</li>
      <li class="list">With Tableau Desktop and the proper permissions, you may save and open workbooks to and from Tableau Public using the <strong class="screen-text">Server</strong> menu and by selecting options under Tableau Public.</li>
      <li class="list">With the free Tableau Public client, you may only save workbooks to and from the web.

    <p class="normal">Publishing to<a id="_idIndexMarker1341"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1342"/> Tableau Server and Tableau Online is a similar experience. To publish to Tableau Server<a id="_idIndexMarker1343"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1344"/> or Tableau Online, from the menu select <strong class="screen-text">Server</strong> | <strong class="screen-text">Publish Workbook</strong>. If you are not signed in to a server, you will be prompted to sign in:</p>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 16.4: The sign-in screen for Tableau Online</p>
    <p class="normal">You must have a <a id="_idIndexMarker1345"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1346"/>user account with publish permissions for one or more projects. Enter the URL or IP address of the Tableau Server or the Tableau Online URL, your username, and password. Once signed in, you will be prompted to select a site, if you have access to more than one. Finally, you will see the publish screen:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_16_05.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 16.5: Publishing to Tableau Online</p>
    <p class="normal">You have<a id="_idIndexMarker1347"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1348"/> multiple options when you publish:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="list">Select the <strong class="screen-text">Project</strong> to <a id="_idIndexMarker1349"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1350"/>which you wish to publish and <strong class="screen-text">Name</strong> your workbook. If a workbook has already been published with the same name as the selected project, you will be prompted to overwrite it.</li>
      <li class="list">You may give the workbook a <strong class="screen-text">Description</strong> and use <strong class="screen-text">Add Tags</strong> to make searching for and finding your workbook easier.</li>
      <li class="list">You may also specify which <strong class="screen-text">Sheets</strong> to include in the published workbook. Any sheets you check will be included; any you uncheck will not.</li>
      <li class="list">You may edit user and group <strong class="screen-text">Permissions</strong> to define who has permission to view, interact with, and alter your workbook. By default, the project settings are used. Here is an example workbook with individual users and permissions:

    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li class="list">You may<a id="_idIndexMarker1351"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1352"/> edit properties for data sources. The options are described in detail in the next section.</li>
      <li class="list">You also have the<a id="_idIndexMarker1353"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1354"/> option to <strong class="screen-text">Show Sheets as Tabs</strong>. When checked, users on Tableau Server will be able to navigate between sheets using tabs similar to those shown at the bottom of Tableau Desktop. This option must be checked if you plan to have actions that navigate between views.</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="screen-text">Show Selections</strong> indicates that you wish any active selections of marks to be retained in the published views.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Editing data sources gives you options for authentication and scheduling:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="list">For each data connection used in the workbook, you may determine how database connections are authenticated. The options will depend on the data source as well as the configuration of Tableau Server. Various options include embedding a password, impersonating a user, or prompting a Tableau Server user for credentials.</li>
      <li class="list">You may specify a schedule for Tableau Server to run refreshes of any data extracts.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Any live connections or extracted connections that will be refreshed on the server must define connections that work from the server. This means that all applicable database drivers must be installed on the server; all network, internet connections, and ports required for accessing database servers and cloud-based data must be open.</p>
    <p class="normal">Additionally, any external files referenced by a workbook (for example, image files and non-extracted file-based data sources) that were not included when the workbook was published must be referenced using a location that is accessible by Tableau Server (for example, a network path with security settings allowing the Tableau Server process read access).</p>
    <p class="normal">Once dashboards and views have been published to Tableau Server, you and other users with access will be able to interact with them. We'll consider the details next.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-301" class="title">Interacting with Tableau Server</h2>
    <p class="normal">After a <a id="_idIndexMarker1355"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1356"/>workbook is published to Tableau Server, other users will be able to view and interact with the visualizations and dashboards using a web browser. Once logged in to Tableau Server, they will be able to browse content for which they have appropriate permissions. These users will be able to use any features built into the dashboards, such as quick filters, parameters, actions, or drilldowns. Everything is rendered as <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">HTML5</code>, so the only requirement for the user to view and interact with views and dashboards is an <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">HTML5</code>-compatible web browser.</p>
    <div class="packt_tip">
      <p>The <strong class="bold">Tableau Mobile</strong> app, available<a id="_idIndexMarker1357"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1358"/> for iOS and Android devices, can enhance the experience for mobile users. Use Tableau's device designer to target layouts for specific devices.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">For the most part, interacting with a workbook on Server or Online is very similar to interacting with a workbook in Tableau Desktop or Reader. Quick filters, parameters, actions, and tooltips all look and behave similarly.</p>
    <p class="normal">You will find some additional features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="list">The side menu gives you various options related to managing and navigating Tableau Server.</li>
      <li class="list">Below that, you'll find a breadcrumb trail informing you which workbook and view you are currently viewing.</li>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 16.7: The Tableau Server toolbar</p>
	</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li class="list"><strong class="screen-text">Undo</strong> and <strong class="screen-text">Redo</strong> give you the ability to step backward and forward through interactions.</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="screen-text">Revert</strong> gives you the ability to undo all changes and revert to the original dashboard.</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="screen-text">Refresh</strong> reloads the dashboard and refreshes the data. However, this does not refresh any extracts of the data.</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="screen-text">Pause</strong> allows you to pause refreshing of the dashboard based on actions, filter selections, or parameter value changes until you have made all the changes you wish.</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="screen-text">View</strong> allows<a id="_idIndexMarker1359"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1360"/> you to save the current state of the dashboard based on selections, filters, and parameter values so you can quickly return to it at a later point. You can also find your saved views here.</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="screen-text">Alert</strong> allows you to set up a conditional alert. When a mark in a view reaches a threshold you define, you will receive an alert through email. For example, you might have a line chart of profitability and expect an alert on a day when you meet an organizational goal. Or you might set an alert to receive notification when the count of errors indicated in the data exceeds <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">0</code>.</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="screen-text">Subscribe</strong> allows you to schedule periodic emails of a screenshot of the dashboard. Administrators may also subscribe other users. You might want to consider this option to distribute daily performance reports, sales updates, inventory counts, or any other information you want to push out!</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="screen-text">Edit</strong> allows you to edit the dashboard. The interface is very similar to Tableau Desktop. The Tableau Administrator can enable or disable web editing per user or group and also control permissions for saving edited views.</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="screen-text">Share</strong> gives you options for sharing the workbook. These options include a URL you can distribute to other licensed users, as well as code for embedding the dashboard in a web page.</li>
      <li class="list">The <strong class="screen-text">Download</strong> button allows you to download the data, images of the dashboard, the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">.pdf</code>, or the workbook, as described earlier.</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="screen-text">Comments</strong> give you the ability to collaborate with other Tableau Server users by making comments on the view and responding to the comments of others.</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="screen-text">Full Screen</strong> allows you<a id="_idIndexMarker1361"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1362"/> to view the dashboard or view in full screen mode.</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="screen-text">Metrics</strong> (not shown in <em class="italics">Figure 16.7</em>) give you<strong class="screen-text"> </strong>the ability to define key numbers or indicators that you wish to track.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Now that we've explored some of Tableau Server's interactive capabilities, let's consider some further distribution options with Tableau Server and Tableau Online.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-302" class="title">Additional distribution options using Tableau Server or Tableau Online</h2>
    <p class="normal">Both Tableau Server<a id="_idIndexMarker1363"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1364"/> and Tableau Online provide several other<a id="_idIndexMarker1365"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1366"/> options for sharing your views, dashboards, and data. Along with allowing users to log in to Tableau Server, you might consider the following options:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="list">Dashboards, views, and story points can be embedded in websites, portals, and SharePoint. Single-sign-on options exist to allow your website authentication to integrate seamlessly with Tableau Server.</li>
      <li class="list">Tableau Server allows users to subscribe to views and dashboards and schedule email delivery. The email will contain an up-to-date image of the view and a link to the dashboard on Tableau Server.</li>
      <li class="list">The <strong class="bold">tabcmd</strong> utility<a id="_idIndexMarker1367"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1368"/> is provided with Tableau Server and may be installed on other machines. The utility provides the ability to automate many functions of Tableau Server, including export features, publishing, and user and security management. This opens up quite a few possibilities for automating delivery.</li>
      <li class="list">The <strong class="bold">REST API</strong> allows programmatic <a id="_idIndexMarker1369"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1370"/>interaction with Tableau Server. This gives you a wide range of options for exporting data, images, and documents and distributing to users as well as access to usage statistics, users, permissions, and more!</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">All these options greatly extend the flexibility of distributing data and visualizations to those in the organization who need them most!</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-303" class="title">Summary</h1>
    <p class="normal">Tableau is an amazing platform for exploring, prepping, and cleaning your data as you create useful and meaningful visualizations and dashboards to understand and communicate key insights. Throughout this book, we've considered how to connect to data—whether file-based, in an on-premises database, or in the cloud. You've worked through examples of exploring and prepping data to clean it and structure it for analysis. We've covered numerous types of visualization and how they can uncover deep analytical insights. The four main types of calculations were explored in depth, giving you the tools to extend the data, analysis, and user interactivity. You've built dashboards and told stories with the data. In this chapter, we considered how to share the results of all your work with others.</p>
    <p class="normal">You now have a solid foundation. At its core, the Tableau platform is intuitive and easy to use. As you dive deeper, the simplicity becomes increasingly beautiful. As you discover new ways to understand your data, solve complex problems, ask new questions, and find new answers in your datasets, your new Tableau skills will help you uncover, interpret, and share new insights hidden in your data.</p>
