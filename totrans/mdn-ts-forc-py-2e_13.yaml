- en: In this part, we focus on the exciting field of deep learning to tackle time
    series problems. This part starts with a good introduction of the necessary concepts
    and slowly builds up to different specialized architectures that are suited to
    handle time series data. It also talks about global models in deep learning and
    some strategies to make them work better. And to top it off, we dive deep into
    generating probabilistic forecasts which is highly relevant in todayâ€™s forecasting
    landscape.
