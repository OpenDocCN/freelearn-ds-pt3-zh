- en: The world of computing has seen an incredible revolution in the past 30 years.
    Not so long ago, high-performance computations required expensive hardware; proprietary
    software costing hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars; knowledge of computer
    languages such as FORTRAN, C, or C++; and familiarity with specialized libraries.
    Even after obtaining the proper hardware and software, just setting up a working
    environment for advanced scientific computing and data handling was a serious
    challenge. Many engineers and scientists were forced to become operating systems
    wizards just to be able to maintain the toolset required by their daily computational
    work.

- en: Scientists, engineers, and programmers were quick to address this issue. Hardware
    costs decreased as performance went up, and there was a great push to develop
    scripting languages that allowed integration of disparate libraries through multiple
    platforms. It was in this environment that Python was being developed in the late
    1980s, under the leadership of Guido Van Rossum. From the beginning, Python was
    designed to be a cutting-edge, high-level computer language with a simple enough
    structure that its basics could be quickly learned even by programmers who are
    not experts.

- en: One of Python's attractive features for rapid development was its interactive
    shell, through which programmers could experiment with concepts interactively
    before including them in scripts. However, the original Python shell had a limited
    set of features and better interactivity was necessary. Starting from 2001, Fernando
    Perez started developing IPython, an improved interactive Python shell designed
    specifically for scientific computing.

- en: Since then, IPython has grown to be a full-fledged computational environment
    built on top of Python. One of most exciting developments is the IPython notebook,
    a web-based interface for computing with Python. In this book, the reader is guided
    to a thorough understanding of the notebook's capabilities in easy steps. In the
    course of learning about the notebook interface, the reader will learn the essential
    features of several tools, such as NumPy for efficient array-based computations,
    matplotlib for professional-grade graphics, pandas for data handling and analysis,
    and SciPy for scientific computation. The presentation is made fun and lively
    by the introduction of applied examples related to each of the topics. Last but
    not least, we introduce advanced methods for using GPU-based parallelized computations.

    powerful hardware and advanced libraries easily available through the IPython
    notebook provides unprecedented power. We expect that our readers will be as motivated
    as we are to explore this brave new computational world.
