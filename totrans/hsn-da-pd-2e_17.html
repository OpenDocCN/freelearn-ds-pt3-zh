			<h1 id="_idParaDest-255"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor254"/>Chapter 12</em>: The Road Ahead</h1>
			<p>Throughout this book, we have covered a lot of material, and you are now capable of performing data analysis and machine learning tasks entirely in Python. We began our journey by learning about some introductory statistics and how to set up our environment for data science in Python. Then, we learned about the basics of using <strong class="source-inline">pandas</strong> and how to bring data into Python. With this knowledge, we were able to work with APIs, read from files, and query databases to grab data for our analyses.</p>
			<p>After we collected our data, we learned how to perform data wrangling in order to clean up our data and get it into a usable format. Next, we learned how to work with time series and combine data from different sources as well as aggregate it. Once we had a good handle on data wrangling, we moved on to visualizations and used <strong class="source-inline">pandas</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">matplotlib</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">seaborn</strong> to create a variety of plot types, and we also learned how to customize them.</p>
			<p>Armed with this knowledge, we were able to tackle some real-world analyses by looking at the financial data for bitcoin and the FAANG stocks and trying to detect hackers attempting to authenticate to a web application. In addition, we learned how to build our own Python packages, write our own classes, and simulate data.</p>
			<p>Finally, we got an introduction to machine learning using <strong class="source-inline">scikit-learn</strong>. We discussed how to build model pipelines, taking us from preprocessing the data through to model fitting. Afterward, we discussed how we can evaluate the performance of our models and how we can try to improve their performance. Our discussion of machine learning culminated in using machine learning models to detect hackers attempting to gain access to a web application through a brute-force attack.</p>
			<p>Now that you have gained all this knowledge, it is important to nurture it so that you retain it. This means that you must practice every chance you get. This chapter provides the following resources for continuing your data science journey:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Resources for finding data on a variety of topics</li>
				<li>Websites and services to practice working with data</li>
				<li>Coding challenges and educational content to improve your Python skills</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-256"><a id="_idTextAnchor255"/>Data resources</h1>
			<p>As with any skill, to get better we need to practice, which for us means we need to find data to practice on. There is no best dataset to practice with; rather, each person should find data that they are<a id="_idIndexMarker1603"/> interested in exploring. While this section is by no means comprehensive, it contains resources for data from various topics in the hopes that everyone will find something they want to use.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">Unsure of what kind of data to look for? What are some of the things you have wondered about related to a topic that you find interesting? Has data been collected on this topic, and can you access it? Let your curiosity guide you.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-257"><a id="_idTextAnchor256"/>Python packages</h2>
			<p>Both <strong class="source-inline">seaborn</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">scikit-learn</strong> provide built-in sample datasets that you can experiment with in order to get more<a id="_idIndexMarker1604"/> practice with the material we've covered in the book and to try out new techniques. These datasets are often very clean and thus easy to work with. Once you're comfortable <a id="_idIndexMarker1605"/>with the techniques, you can move on to finding data using the other resources that are mentioned in the following sections, which will be more representative of real-world data.</p>
			<h3>Seaborn</h3>
			<p>Seaborn provides the <strong class="source-inline">load_dataset()</strong> function, which reads the data from a CSV file in a small GitHub<a id="_idIndexMarker1606"/> repository for <strong class="source-inline">seaborn</strong> data. These datasets are the ones that are used in the <strong class="source-inline">seaborn</strong> documentation, so it is important to keep in mind that they may change. The data can be obtained from the repository directly at <a href="https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data">https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data</a>.</p>
			<h3>Scikit-learn</h3>
			<p>Scikit-learn includes a <strong class="source-inline">datasets</strong> module, which can be used to generate random datasets to test algorithms or<a id="_idIndexMarker1607"/> to import certain datasets that are popular in the machine learning community. Be sure to check out the documentation for more information:</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-261"><a id="_idTextAnchor260"/>Practicing working with data</h1>
			<p>Throughout this book, we have<a id="_idIndexMarker1618"/> worked with various datasets from different sources with step-by-step instructions. It doesn't have to stop here, though. This section is dedicated to some resources that can be used to continue with guided instruction and, eventually, work toward building a model for a predefined problem.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Kaggle</strong> (<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">https://www.kaggle.com/</a>) offers<a id="_idIndexMarker1619"/> content for learning data science, datasets for exploration that are shared by members of the community, and competitions that have been posted by companies—perhaps the Netflix recommendation contest sounds familiar (<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data">https://www.kaggle.com/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data</a>)? These contests are a great way for you to practice your machine learning skills and become more visible in the community (especially to potential employers).</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">Kaggle isn't the<a id="_idIndexMarker1620"/> only place you can participate in data science competitions. Some additional ones are listed at <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/top-competitive-data-science-platforms-other-than-kaggle-2995e9dad93c">https://towardsdatascience.com/top-competitive-data-science-platforms-other-than-kaggle-2995e9dad93c</a>.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">DataCamp</strong> (<a href="https://www.datacamp.com/">https://www.datacamp.com/</a>), while not entirely free, provides various data science courses in Python. They include<a id="_idIndexMarker1621"/> instructional videos and fill-in-the-blank coding practice problems so that you can build up your understanding of the topics.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-262"><a id="_idTextAnchor261"/>Python practice</h1>
			<p>We have seen throughout this book that working with data in Python isn't just <strong class="source-inline">pandas</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">matplotlib</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">numpy</strong>; there are many ways our workflow can benefit from us being strong Python programmers in general. With strong Python skills, we can build web applications with Flask, make requests of an API, efficiently iterate over combinations or permutations, and find ways to speed up our code. While this book didn't focus on honing these skills<a id="_idIndexMarker1622"/> directly, here are some free resources for practicing with Python and thinking like a programmer:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">HackerRank</strong>: <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com">https://www.hackerrank.com</a></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Codewars</strong>: <a href="https://www.codewars.com">https://www.codewars.com</a></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">LeetCode</strong>: <a href="https://www.leetcode.com">https://www.leetcode.com</a></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">CodinGame</strong>: <a href="https://www.codingame.com">https://www.codingame.com</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p>While not free, <strong class="bold">Python Morsels</strong> (<a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/">https://www.pythonmorsels.com/</a>) provides weekly Python exercises that will <a id="_idIndexMarker1623"/>help you learn to write more Pythonic code and get more familiar with the Python standard library. Exercises vary in difficulty but can be set to a higher or lower difficulty as needed.</p>
			<p>Another great resource is <strong class="bold">Pramp</strong> (<a href="https://www.pramp.com">https://www.pramp.com</a>), which lets you practice for a programming<a id="_idIndexMarker1624"/> interview with a randomly assigned peer. Your peer will interview you with a random question and evaluate how you approach the interview, your code, and how well you explain yourself. After 30 minutes, it's your turn to interview your peer. </p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Khan Academy</strong> (<a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">https://www.khanacademy.org/</a>) can be a great resource for learning more about a <a id="_idIndexMarker1625"/>subject. If you want a primer on computer science algorithms or some of the mathematics behind machine learning algorithms (such as linear algebra and calculus), then this is a great place to start.</p>
			<p>Lastly, <strong class="bold">LinkedIn Learning</strong> (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/">https://www.linkedin.com/learning/</a>) has many video courses on a wide<a id="_idIndexMarker1626"/> range of topics, including Python, data science, and machine learning. New users get a free month-long trial. Consider taking the <em class="italic">Learning the Python 3 Standard Library</em> course (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-the-python-3-standard-library">https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-the-python-3-standard-library</a>) to level up your Python skills; as we saw throughout this book, a solid command of the standard library helps us write more concise <a id="_idIndexMarker1627"/>and efficient code.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-263"><a id="_idTextAnchor262"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>This chapter provided you with many places where you can find datasets across myriad topics. In addition, you also learned about various websites where you can take courses and work through tutorials, practice machine learning, and improve your Python skills.It's important to keep your skills sharp and stay curious, so, for whatever interests you, look for data and perform your own analyses. These are things you can put on your GitHub account as your data portfolio.</p>
