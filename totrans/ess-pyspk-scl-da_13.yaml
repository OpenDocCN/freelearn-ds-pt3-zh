- en: Once we have clean and integrated data in the data lake and have trained and
    built machine learning models at scale, the final step is to convey actionable
    insights to business owners in a meaningful manner to help them make business
    decisions. This section covers the **business intelligence (BI)** and SQL Analytics
    part of data analytics. It starts with various data visualization techniques using
    notebooks. Then, it introduces you to Spark SQL to perform business analytics
    at scale and shows techniques to connect BI and SQL Analysis tools to Apache Spark
    clusters. The section ends with an introduction to the Data Lakehouse paradigm
    to bridge the gap between data warehouses and data lakes to provide a single,
    unified, scalable storage to cater to all aspects of data analytics, including
    data engineering, data science, and business analytics.
