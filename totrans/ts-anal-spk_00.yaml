- en: Time series analysis—extracting insights from time series—is crucial for businesses
    and organizations to make informed decisions. This is achieved by analyzing patterns,
    trends, and anomalies in data collected at intervals of time. Apache Spark is
    a powerful big data processing framework that enables the efficient processing
    of large-scale time series data, making it an ideal tool for handling the volume
    and complexity of such data.
