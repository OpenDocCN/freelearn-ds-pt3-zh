<h1 data-number="2">Python: The Beginning</h1>
<p>Programming with computers is one of the most rewarding and frustrating of human endeavors.</p>
<p>Those rewards can be in the form of money, as we can see with today’s high-tech salaries. I would argue, however, that the most rewarding part of mastering programming is to make yourself into a computer power user who can execute both simple and complex applications and analyses, written in reusable code, with ease.</p>
<p>The frustrations will come and go, and it is a good thing: you, like me and millions before you, will learn from each mistake (it helps to be a pedant, perhaps, but not being one myself I can’t be sure). You will grow and learn with each exercise in this book, and by asking the right questions and paying close attention you can avoid some of these issues.</p>
<p>If you are an ArcGIS expert or novice, seeking to expand on your skillsets: congratulations, you are in the right place. In this book you will learn how to take your existing GIS expertise (or interest) and multiply its potential using a deceptively simple programming language called Python.</p>
<p>Computer programming is its own vast field that cannot be captured in one chapter, of course. In this chapter I will explain the basic knowledge necessary to read, write and run Python scripts. We’ll leave the ArcGIS tools for later chapters and focus on Python: its beginnings, its current state, how to use it, and importantly, what Python is and what it is not.</p>
<p>We will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basics of Python</li>
<li>Basics of computer programming</li>
<li>Installing and importing modules</li>
<li>Writing and executing scripts</li>
</ul>

<h2 data-number="2.1">Python: Built Different</h2>
<p>Guido Van Rossum, the creator of the Python programming language, was frustrated with the state of computer programming in the late 1980s. Programming languages were too complex, and at the same time, too loose with their formatting requirements. This led to large codebases with complex scripts poorly written and rarely documented.</p>
<p>Merely running a simple program could take a long time, as the code would need to be type-checked (variables declared correctly and assigned to the correct data type) and compiled (converted from high-level code written in text files into the assembly language or machine code understood by the CPU).</p>
<p>As the Dutch programmer completed professional work on the ABC programming language, where he had learned much about language design, he decided he wanted to turn his grips about the limits of ABC and other languages into a hobby.</p>
<p>With a master’s degree in mathematics and computer science from the University of Amsterdam, his hobbies tended towards the computer, but he did have a love for Monty Python, the British comedy series. So, he combined his passions and created Python, which is now used for all kinds of programmatic solutions. Today Python is everywhere, in the internet and appliances and cars and so much more. Because of its ubiquity and its simplicity, it has been adopted by the GIS software ecosystem as a standard programming tool.</p>

<section id="why-python-is-different" class="level2" data-number="2.2">
<h2 data-number="2.2">Why Python is different</h2>
<p>Because of Van Rossum’s extensive experience with the state of computer languages in the 1980s, he was well positioned to create a language that solved many of their deficiencies. He added features that he admired from many other languages and added a few of his own. Here is an incomplete list of Python features built to improve on other languages:</p>

<section id="python-versions" class="level3" data-number="2.2.1">
<h3 data-number="2.2.1">Python Versions</h3>
<p>The original Python version release in 1991 by Van Rossum, Python 1.0 and its successors, was eventually superseded by the widely popular Python 2.x. Care was taken to ensure that version 2.0 and beyond were backwards-compatible with Python 1.x. However, for the new Python 3.0 and beyond, backwards compatibility with Python 1 and Python 2 was broken.</p>
<p>This break has caused a divergence in the Python ecosystem. Some companies chose to stick with Python 2.x, which has meant that the “sunset” date or retirement date for the older version was extended from 2015 until April 2020. Now that the sunset date has been passed, there is no active work by the <strong>Python Software Foundation</strong> (<strong>PSF</strong>) on Python 2.x. Python 3.x development continues and will continue into the future, overseen by the PSF.</p>
<p>Van Rossum served as the Benevolent Dictator for Life of the PSF until he resigned the position in 2018.</p>

<h4 data-number="2.2.1.1">ArcGIS Python Versions</h4>
<p>Since ArcMap version 9.x, Python has been integrated into the ArcGIS software suite. However, ArcGIS Desktop and ArcGIS Pro now both depend on different versions of Python.</p>
</section>
<section id="arcgis-desktop-python-2.x" class="level4" data-number="2.2.1.2">
<h4 data-number="2.2.1.2">ArcGIS Desktop: Python 2.x</h4>
<p>ArcGIS Desktop (or ArcMap) version 9.0 and above ships with Python 2.x included. The installer for ArcGIS would automatically install Python 2.x and would add the <code>arcpy</code> module (originally <code>arcgisscripting</code>) to the Python path variable, making it available for scripting.</p>
<p>ArcMap, ArcCatalog, ArcGIS Engine, and ArcGIS Server all depend on <code>arcpy</code> and the Python 2.x version included when the ArcGIS Desktop or Enterprise software is installed.</p>
</section>
<section id="arcgis-pro-python-3.x" class="level4" data-number="2.2.1.3">
<h4 data-number="2.2.1.3">ArcGIS Pro: Python 3.x</h4>
<p>ArcGIS Pro, which was designed after the decision to sunset Python 2.0 was announced, was divorced from the Python 2.x ecosystem and instead shipped with Python 3.x.</p>
<p>Instead of <code>arcpy</code>, ArcGIS Pro uses the ArcGIS API for Python.</p>
</section>
<section id="managing-both-versions" class="level4" data-number="2.2.1.4">
<h4 data-number="2.2.1.4">Managing both versions</h4>
<p>The sunsetting of ArcGIS Desktop has been extended to March 2025, meaning that Python 2.7 will be included by Esri until that time despite it being officially retired by the Python Software Foundation.</p>
<p>Because of this, we will learn use virtual environments to manage the versions, and you will learn about the PATH and PYTHONPATH environmental variables, which control which version of Python is used to execute a script.</p>

<section id="what-is-python" class="level3" data-number="2.2.2">
<h3 data-number="2.2.2">What is Python?</h3>
<p>In short, Python is an application: <code>python.exe</code>. This application is also an executable file, meaning it can be run by itself to interpret code, or it can be called from other applications to run custom scripts. This standard interoperability is part of why it is included in applications such as ArcGIS Pro. When ArcGIS is installed, Python is also installed on your computer, along with a series of supporting files and folders.</p>
<p>Python includes a large standard library of tools or “modules”. These include support for internet requests, advanced math, CSV reading and writing, JSON serialization, and many more modules included in the Python core. While these tools are powerful, Python was also built to be extensible, meaning that third-party modules can be easily added to a Python installation. The ArcGIS Python modules are both good examples of extending the capabilities of Python. There are hundreds of thousands of others, covering almost any type of programming need, of varying quality.</p>
<p>Python is written in the programming language C. There are variants of Python written in other languages for a variety of technical reasons, but most implementations of Python are built on top of C. This means that Python is often expanded through modules built on top of C code, usually for speed improvement reasons. A Python code “layer” or “wrapper” is put on top of C code to make it work with normal Python packages, gaining the simplicity of Python and the processing speed boosts of precompiled C code. NumPy and SciPy are examples of this type of module, and are included with the ArcGIS installation of Python.</p>
<p>Python is free and open software, which is another reason it is packaged with so many other software applications for automation purposes. Python can also be installed separately, using a free installer from the Python Software Foundation.</p>

<p>On Windows machines, Python is not included by default – it must be installed along with ArcGIS or separately using an installer from the Python Software Foundation. Once the ArcGIS Installer is run, you will see a folder inside the <code>C:\ drive</code>. You can set a custom location or use the default.</p>

<section id="python-interpreter" class="level3" data-number="2.2.3">
<h3 data-number="2.2.3">Python Interpreter</h3>
<p>When you start python.exe by double-clicking on it (see below for multiple other ways to run the executable), it starts what is known as the Python Interpreter.</p>
<p>This is a useful interface, allowing you to enter, one line at a time, bits of code for testing and confirmation. Once the line is entered, push Enter/Return and the code will be executed. This tool helps you both learn coding and test code in the same environment.</p>
<section id="starting-the-interpreter" class="level5" data-number="2.2.3.0.1">
<h5 data-number="2.2.3.0.1">Starting the Interpreter</h5>
<p>Double-clicking on <code>python.exe</code> from the folder or starting Python (command line) from the Start Menu, will start the interpreter, which allows for one-line commands to be executed.:</p>

<section id="what-is-a-python-script" class="level4" data-number="2.2.4.1">
<h4 data-number="2.2.4.1">What is a Python script?</h4>
<p>The <code>python.exe</code> executable file, along with being a program where code can be run, will also execute Python scripts. These scripts are simple text files that can be edited by any text editing software. Python scripts are saved with the <code>.py</code> extension.</p>
<p>When a Python script is “run”, it is passed as the first command line argument to the Python executable (<code>python.exe</code>). This program will read and then execute the code from the top to the bottom as long as it is valid Python and it contains no errors. If there is an error encountered, the script will stop and return an error message. If there is no error, nothing will be returned unless you have added “<code>print</code>” statements to return messages from the main loop to the Python window as the script is running.</p>
<p>In this example the script is executed by “passing” the script as an argument to the executable (python.exe), which is explicitly called with the full folder path to the python.exe file to avoid path issues:</p>
<pre><code>C:\Projects&gt;C:\PythonArcGIS\ArcGIS10.5\python.exe chapter1.py</code></pre>
<p>In this example the script is executed by “passing” the script as an argument to the executable, along with optional parameters that are accepted by the script itself before being run:</p>
<pre><code>C:\Projects&gt;C:\PythonArcGIS\ArcGIS10.5\python.exe chapter1.py arg1 arg2</code></pre>
</section>
</section>
<section id="versions-included" class="level3" data-number="2.2.5">
<h3 data-number="2.2.5">Versions included</h3>
<p>Python comes with two versions of the <code>python.exe</code> file. These are the same version of Python, to be clear, but each file has a different role. Python.exe is the main file, and the other version is pythonw.exe. This file will not open an interpreter if double-clicked, as the normal python.exe will. No interpreter is available from pythonw.exe, which is the point: it is used to execute scripts more “silently” than <code>python.exe</code>. Use python.exe for to start the interpreter.</p>

<section id="how-to-call-the-executable" class="level4" data-number="2.2.5.1">
<h4 data-number="2.2.5.1">How to call the executable</h4>
<p>The Python “executable” (<code>python.exe</code>) is accessed to run the Python Interpreter or to run a custom Python script. There are many different ways to “call” or start the Python executable:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../media/file5.png" />
</figure>
<ul>
<li>Double-click on python.exe
<ul>
<li>Starts the Python Interpreter</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Open IDLE, the included integrated development environment (IDE)
<ul>
<li>Should be accessible in your Start menu on Windows in the ArcGIS folder</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Open a CMD terminal and type “python”
<ul>
<li>Only works if the Python executable is in the PATH environment variable</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Using a third-party IDE such as PyCharm
<ul>
<li>Each PyCharm project can have its own virtual environment, and therefore its own executable, or it can use the one installed by Esri when ArcGIS is installed.</li>
<li>There are a lot of IDEs but PyCharm is the one I recommend for a variety of reasons.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Using a Jupyter Notebook, which we will discuss extensively in this book
<ul>
<li>This requires the installation of Jupyter, which is not included in the standard Python installation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Inside ArcGIS Desktop or ArcGIS Pro
<ul>
<li>There are menu buttons that allow you to start a Python interpreter window inside ArcMap or ArcCatalog or ArcGIS Pro.</li>
<li>Run code one line at a time or by using the load script command in the right-click menu.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<section id="idle-development-environment" class="level3" data-number="2.2.6">
<h3 data-number="2.2.6">IDLE development environment</h3>
<figure>
<img src="../media/file6.png" />
</figure>
<p>The included IDE called IDLE is a useful environment that comes standard with every Python instance. IDLE is useful for the Python Interpreter, but also because you can create and execute scripts in this environment easily by opening a new script from the File menu, and then using the script’s Run menu to execute the script.</p>
<figure>
<img src="../media/file7.png" />
</figure>
<section id="the-path-environment-variable" class="level4" data-number="2.2.6.1">
<h4 data-number="2.2.6.1">The Path environment variable</h4>
<p>On Windows there is a system environment variable known as the Windows Path environment variable. This variable is available to all applications installed on the machine. Other programs use it for different purposes, but for Python it is used to find all available Python executables and modules.</p>
<p>This is important to understand because you may end up with multiple versions of Python on your computer one day, or after just one install of ArcGIS Desktop or Pro. When</p>
<p>If a script is run in a CMD window using the “<code>python script.py</code>” (passing the script to Python as an argument), and it contains import statements, then there are three things that have to happen.</p>
<p>First, Windows will look for an executable called python.exe in the Path. If it is there, it will then confirm that the script is valid. If it is, then Python will run the script and the Path environment variable will be checked to look for allowed locations for all modules you are trying to import.</p>
<p>So the Python executable cannot be run by name (instead of file location) until the <code>python.exe</code> is in the Path. Here is how you edit the Path variable:</p>
<p>Open up the <strong>Advanced System Settings</strong> in the <strong>Control Panel</strong>:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../media/file8.png" />

<h3 data-number="2.2.7">Locate and double-click on the Path variable (or press edit when selected):</h3>
<figure>
<img src="../media/file9.png" />
</figure>
<p>Add a new line to the Path environment variable in the interface. If you have multiple version of Python and you are not using virtual environments, be sure to order the folders in the Path so that the correct version of Python is called when you type “<code>python</code>” into a CMD line window:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../media/file10.png" />
</figure>
<p>If you are not allowed to edit the Path variable, you can still run Python in the command line by referring to it using the whole path to the executable: <code>C:\ArcGIS10.8\Python\python.exe script.py</code></p>
<p><strong>The operating system and Python system modules</strong></p>
<p>Two modules (code libraries) built into Python need to be mentioned first. The <code>os</code> and <code>sys</code> modules, also called the operating system module (<code>os</code>) and the Python system module (<code>sys</code>) are used to control Windows system operations and Python system operations respectively.</p>
<section id="the-os-module" class="level5" data-number="2.2.7.0.1">
<h5 data-number="2.2.7.0.1">The OS module</h5>
<p>The <code>os</code> module is used for many things, including folder path operations such as creating folders, removing folders, checking if a folder or file exists, or executing a file using the operating system-associated application used to run that file extension. Getting the current directory, copying files, and more is possible with this module.</p>
<p>In this example, a string is passed to the <code>os.path.exists</code> <strong></strong> method, which is Boolean. If it returns False, the folder does not exist, and is then created using the <code>os.mkdir</code> method:</p>
<pre><code>import os
folderpath = &quot;C:\Test_folder&quot;
if not os.path.exists(folderpath):
   os.mkdir(folderpath)</code></pre>

<section id="the-sys-module-accepts-arguments" class="level4" data-number="2.2.7.1">
<h4 data-number="2.2.7.1">The sys module accepts arguments</h4>
<p>The sys module allows you to accept arguments to a script at runtime, meaning when it is executed. This is done by using the <code>sys.argv</code> method, which is a list containing all arguments made to Python during the executing of the script.</p>
<pre><code>If a name variable is using the sys module to accept parameters, here is what the script looks like:
import sys
name = sys.argv[1]
print(name)</code></pre>
</section>
<section id="the-system-path" class="level4" data-number="2.2.7.2">
<h4 data-number="2.2.7.2">The System path</h4>
<p>The sys module contains the Python path or system path (system in this case means Python). This is a list that Python uses to search for importable modules, after accessing the Windows path. If you can’t edit the Windows path as explained above (due to permissions usually), you can alter the Python path at runtime using the system path.</p>
<p>The <code>sys.path</code> list is a part of the <code>sys</code> module built into Python:</p>

<h4 data-number="2.3.2.1">For loops</h4>
<p>A “for loop” is an iteration implementation that, when presented with a data list, will perform an operation on each member of the list.</p>
<p>In this example, a list of integers are assigned to the variable name <code>data_list</code>. The list is then used to construct a for loop using the format “<code>for {var} in {iterable}</code>” where {var} is a variable name that is assigned to each object in the list, one at a time as the loop progresses. One convention is to use “<code>item</code>” but it can be any valid variable:</p>
<pre><code>data_list = [45,56,34,12,2]
for item in data_list:
    print (item * 2)
90
112
68
24
4</code></pre>

<section id="while-loops" class="level4" data-number="2.3.2.2">
<h4 data-number="2.3.2.2">While loops</h4>
<p>A “while loop” is an iteration implementation that will loop until a specific threshold is met. While loops can be dangerous as they can cause an infinite loop in a script if the threshold is never met.</p>
<p>In this example, the while loop will run (doing nothing but adding 1 to x until it reaches 100, upon which the threshold is met and the while loop will end</p>
<pre><code>x = 0
while x &lt; 100:
    x = x + 1   #same as x += 1</code></pre>

<section id="counter-and-enumerators" class="level3" data-number="2.3.3">
<h3 data-number="2.3.3">Counter and enumerators</h3>
<p>Iteration in for loops or while loops often requires the use of counters (also called enumerators) to track loops in an iteration.</p>
<p>For loops have the option to use the enumerate function by passing the iterator to the function and using a count variable (can be any valid variable name but count is logical) in front of the item variable. The count variable will keep track of the loops, starting at index zero:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; data_list = [&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;c&#39;,&#39;d&#39;,&#39;e&#39;]
&gt;&gt;&gt; for count,item in enumerate(data_list):
...     print(count, item)
... 
0 a
1 b
2 c
3 d
4 e</code></pre>
<p>In Python the shortcut “x += y” is used to increase the value of x while keeping the same variable name, which is the same as “x = x +y”:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 0
&gt;&gt;&gt; while x &lt;100:
...    x = x + 1
&gt;&gt;&gt; x
100
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 0

<section id="conditionals" class="level3" data-number="2.3.4">
<h3 data-number="2.3.4">Conditionals</h3>
<p>If statements and Elif statements (short for else if) and Else statements are used to create conditions that will be used to evaluate data objects. If statements can be by themselves (<code>elif</code> and <code>else</code> are optional) and is used by declaring the keyword if and then the condition the data must meet:</p>
<pre><code>list_var = [1,’1’,1.0]
for item in list_var:
  if type(item) == type(0):
    print(‘Integer’)
  elif type(item) == type(‘a’):

<section id="if-vs-else" class="level3" data-number="2.3.5">
<h3 data-number="2.3.5">If vs Else</h3>
<p>If statements are usually specific to one condition, while else statements are used as catch-alls to ensure that any data that goes through the if statement will have some way of being dealt with, even if it doesn’t meet the condition of the if statement. Elif statements, which are dependent on the if statement existing and are also condition specific, are not catch-all statements.</p>

<section id="list-position-or-why-programmers-count-from-0" class="level3" data-number="2.3.6">
<h3 data-number="2.3.6">List Position (or why programmers count from 0)</h3>
<p>Iteration occurs over lists that contain data. Within the list, these data are differentiated by list order or position. Items in a list are retrieved by item index, the (current) position of the data in the list.</p>
<section id="zero-based-indexing" class="level5" data-number="2.3.6.0.1">
<h5 data-number="2.3.6.0.1">Zero-based indexing</h5>
<p>In Python, like most computer programming languages, the first item in a list is at index 0, not index 1.</p>
<p>This is a bit confusing to beginners but is a programming standard. It is slightly more computationally efficient to retrieve an item in a list that starts with 0 than a list that starts with 1, and this became the standard in C and its precursors, which meant that Python (written in C) uses zero-based indexing.</p>

<section id="data-extraction-using-index-position" class="level5" data-number="2.3.6.0.2">
<h5 data-number="2.3.6.0.2">Data extraction using index position</h5>
<p>This is the basic format of data retrieval from a list. This list of strings has an order, and the string “Bill” is the second item, meaning it is at index 1. To assign this string to variable, we pass the index into square brackets:</p>
<pre><code>names = [“Silas”, “Bill”, ”Dara”]
name_bill = names[1]</code></pre>

<section id="data-extraction-using-reverse-index-position" class="level5" data-number="2.3.6.0.3">
<h5 data-number="2.3.6.0.3">Data extraction using reverse index position</h5>
<p>This is the second format of data retrieval from a list. List order can be used in reverse, meaning that the indexing starts from the last member of the list and counts backwards. Negative numbers are used, starting at -1, which is the index of the last member of the list, and -2 is the second-to-last member of the list and so on. This means that the “Bill” string is at index -2 when using reverse index position, and so -2 must be passed to the list in square brackets:</p>
<pre><code>names = [“Silas”, “Bill”, ”Dara”]
name_bill = names[-2]</code></pre>

<section id="string-format-function" class="level4" data-number="2.3.9.2">
<h4 data-number="2.3.9.2">String format function</h4>
<p>This method of formatting is the preferred form for Python 3 (it is also available in Python 2.7). It allows you to pass the variables to the <code>format</code> function (which is built into all strings) and to have them fill up placeholders within the string. Any data type can be passed to the format function.</p>
<p>In this example, the string template is filled with details contained in other variables using the <code>format</code> string function. The placeholders are filled in the order that the variables are listed, so they must be in correct order. The curly brackets are the placeholders, and the format function will accept arguments and fill in the string:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; year = 1980
&gt;&gt;&gt; day = &quot;Monday&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; month = &quot;Feb&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; template = &quot;It was a cold {} in {} {}&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; template.format(day, month, year)
&#39;It was a cold Monday in Feb 1980&#39;</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the placeholders are named, and are passed to keyword arguments in the format function. The arguments are named and do not need to be in order in the format function:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; template = &#39;It was a cold {day} in {month} {year}&#39;
&gt;&gt;&gt; template.format(month=month,year=year,day=day)
&#39;It was a cold Monday in Feb 1980&#39;</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the placeholders are numbered, which makes it much easier to repeat a string:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; template = &quot;{0},{0} oh no,{1} gotta go&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; template.format(&quot;Louie&quot;, &quot;Me&quot;)

<section id="string-literals" class="level5" data-number="2.3.9.2.1">
<h5 data-number="2.3.9.2.1">String literals</h5>
<p>There is a new (as of Python 3.6) method of formatting strings known as formatted string literals. By adding an “<code>f</code>” before strings, placeholder variables can become populated by variables without using the format function.</p>
<p>In this example, the variables are formatted directly into the string literal, which has an “<code>f</code>” before the string to indicate that it is a string literal:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; year = 1980
&gt;&gt;&gt; day = &quot;Monday&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; month = &quot;Feb&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; str_lit = f&quot;It was a cold {day} in {month} {year}&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; str_lit
&#39;It was a cold Monday in Feb 1980&#39;</code></pre>

<p>To get data out of data containers, square brackets are used to pass either indexes (lists and tuples) or keys (dictionaries). If there is more than one level of data container (i.e. one container contains another), first the data container inside is referenced using an index or key inside a first square bracket, and then the data inside the container is accessed using a second.</p>

<h4 data-number="2.3.12.2">Tuples</h4>
<p>Tuples are ordered lists that can hold any data type, even in the same tuple. They are immutable, meaning they cannot be altered, and data cannot be added to or removed from the tuple once it has been created. They have length and the built-in <code>len</code> function can be used to get the length of the tuple.</p>
<p>In Python they are declared by using round brackets () or the <code>tuple</code> function. Data is accessed using zero-based indexing by passing the index to square brackets next to the tuple.</p>
<p>In this example, a tuple is assigned to the variable name <code>tuple_var</code>, and data is accessed using indexing:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; tuple_var = (&quot;red&quot;,45,&quot;left&quot;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(tuple_var)
&lt;class &#39;tuple&#39;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; (&quot;red&quot;,45,&quot;left&quot;)[0]
&#39;red&#39;
&gt;&gt;&gt; tuple_var[0]

<section id="lists" class="level4" data-number="2.3.12.3">
<h4 data-number="2.3.12.3">Lists</h4>
<p>Lists (often called Arrays in other programming languages) are data containers that can hold any other type of data type, even in the same list, meaning they do not have to be only one data type. Lists can be altered after they are created. In Python they are declared by using square brackets [] or the <code>list</code> function. Data is accessed using zero-based indexing by passing the index to square brackets next to the list.</p>
<p>In this example, a list is assigned to the variable name <code>list_var</code>, and data is accessed using indexing:</p>

<h5 data-number="2.3.12.3.1">Convert between lists and tuples</h5>
<p>Lists can be copied into a new tuple object using the <code>tuple</code> function. Conversely, Tuples can be copied into a list data type using the <code>list</code> function. Technically this does not convert the original data item, but instead creates a copy of the data item in the new data type.</p>
<p>In this example, the list is copied into a tuple data type, and then the tuple is copied into a list data type. Note that the brackets change with each new data type created:</p>
<pre><code> 
&gt;&gt;&gt; tuple_copy = tuple(list_var)
&gt;&gt;&gt; tuple_copy
(&#39;blue&#39;, 42, &#39;right&#39;, &#39;ankle&#39;)

<h5 data-number="2.3.12.3.2">List operations for both tuples and lists</h5>
<p>Lists and tuples can be iterated using for loops. They can both be “sliced” as well, creating a subset of the list or tuple that will be operated on for the for loop or other operation.</p>
</section>
<section id="slicing" class="level5" data-number="2.3.12.3.3">
<h5 data-number="2.3.12.3.3">Slicing</h5>
<p>Slicing a list or tuple will create a new list or tuple. The slice is created by passing indexes to the list or tuple in square brackets, separated by a colon. The first index is the start index, and it can be ignored if it is index 0 (i.e. the beginning of the original list). The second index is the index of the first value that you do NOT want to include (it can be blank if it the rest of the original list).</p>
<pre><code>In this example we see a tuple with three data items sliced to only include the first two items. The string “left” is at index 2 in the tuple, meaning that the last index in the slice will be 2. The slice is assigned to variable name tuple_slice: 
&gt;&gt;&gt; tuple_var = (&quot;red&quot;,45,&quot;left&quot;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; tuple_slice = tuple_var[:2]
&gt;&gt;&gt; tuple_slice
(&#39;red&#39;, 45)</code></pre>
<p>In this example we see a list with four data items sliced to only include the last two items. The first index is the index of the first data item we want (the string “<code>right”</code>). The last index is blank:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; list_var = [&quot;blue&quot;,42,&quot;right&quot;,&quot;ankle&quot;]
&gt;&gt;&gt; list_slice = list_var[2:]

<p>A list can be appended (one data item added) or extended (a list or tuple of data items are all added to the main list). The list order can be reversed or sorted. Built-in functions allow for the calculation of the maximum or minimum value of a list or even the sum of a list (given the data type of the items in the list is correct).</p>

<h5 data-number="2.3.13.0.4">Namespaces</h5>
<p>In Python, there is a concept called namespaces. These are refined into two types of namespaces: global and local.</p>
<p>All variables defined in the main part of a script (outside of any functions) are considered to be in the global namespace. Within the function, variables have a different “namespace”, meaning that variables inside a function are in a <code>local</code> <strong></strong> <code>namespace</code> and are not the same as variables in the main script, which are in the <code>global</code> <strong></strong> <code>namespace</code>. If a variable name inside a function is the same as one outside of the function, changing values inside the function (in the local namespace) will not affect the variable outside the function (in the global namespace)</p>

<h5 data-number="2.3.13.0.5">Function Examples</h5>

<pre><code>def new_function():
    return &quot;hello world&quot;</code></pre>
<p>In this example, an expected parameter is defined in the brackets. When called, this value is supplied and the function then returns the value from the local namespace back to the global namespace in the main loop:</p>
<pre><code>def accept_param(value):
    return value</code></pre>
<p>In this example an expected parameter has a default value assigned, meaning it only has to be supplied if the function uses a non-default parameter:</p>

<h3 data-number="2.3.14">Classes</h3>
<p>Classes are special blocks of code that organize multiple variables and functions into an object with its own methods and functions. Classes make it easy to create code tools that can reference the same internal data lists and functions. The internal functions and variables are able to communicate across the class, so that variables defined in one part of the class are available in another.</p>
<p>Classes use the idea of “self” to allow for the different parts of the class to communicate. By introducing self as a parameter into each function inside a class, the data can be called.</p>
<p>Classes are called or “instantiated” to create a class object. This means the class definition is kind of like a factory for that class, and when you want one of those class objects, you call the class type and pass the correct parameters if required.</p>
<pre><code>class Object():
    def __init__(self, name):
        &#39;accepts a string&#39;
        self.name = name

<h2 data-number="2.4">Installing and importing modules</h2>
<p>To extend the capabilities of the included standard Python library of modules, Python was built to be extensible. Third-party modules are downloaded in some format from a provider (often PyPI, the Python Package Index, where most are held) using either the built-in <code>pip</code> program or another method. For us modules such as <code>arcpy</code> and the ArcGIS API for Python are perfect examples: they extend the capabilities of Python to be able to control the tools that are available within ArcGIS Desktop or Pro respectively.</p>
<section id="using-pip" class="level3" data-number="2.4.1">
<h3 data-number="2.4.1">Using pip</h3>
<p>To make Python module installation easier, Python is now installed with a program called pip. This name is an recursive acronym which stands for Pip Installs Programs. It simplifies installation by allowing for one line command line calls both locates the requested module on an online repository and runs the installation commands.</p>
<p>Pip connects to the Python Package Index (or PyPI). Stored on this repository are hundreds of thousands of free modules written by other developers. It is worth checking the license of the module to confirm that it will allow for your use of its code.</p>
<p>Pip lives in the Scripts folder, where lots of executable files are stored:</p>

<p>Virtual environments are a bit of an odd concept at first, but they are extremely useful when programming in Python. Because you will probably have two different Python versions installed on your computer if you have ArcGIS Desktop and ArcGIS Pro, it is convenient to have these versions located in a virtual environment.</p>
<p>The core idea is to use one of the Python virtual environment modules to create a copy of your preferred Python version, which is then isolated from the rest of the Python versions on your machine. This avoids path issues when calling modules, allowing you to have more than one version of these important modules on the same computer.</p>

<p>To access the wide number of modules in the Python standard library, as well as third-party modules such as <code>arcpy</code>, we need to be able to import these modules in our script (or in the interpreter).</p>

These declare the module or submodules (smaller components of the module) that you will use in the script, and as long as the modules are in the <code>/sites/packages</code> folder in your Python installation, or in the PATH (as <code>arcpy</code> is after its been installed).</p>

<h3 data-number="2.4.5">Importing custom code</h3>
<p>Modules don’t have to just come from “third-parties”: they can come from you as well. With the use of the special <code>__init__.py</code> file, you can convert a normal folder into an importable module</p>
</section>
<section id="the-__init__.py-file" class="level3" data-number="2.4.6">
<h3 data-number="2.4.6">The __init__.py file</h3>
<p>This special file, which can contain code but mostly is just an empty file, indicates to Python that a folder is a module that can be imported into a script. The file itself is just a text file with a <code>.py</code> extension and the name <code>__init__.py</code> (that’s two underscores on each side), which is placed inside a folder. As long as the folder with the <code>__init__.py</code> is either next to the script or in the Python Path (e.g. in the site-packages folder), the code inside the folder can be imported.</p>

<p>Create a folder called <code>mod_test</code>. Copy this script into the folder. Then, create an empty text file called <code>__init__.py</code>:</p>

<p>Create a new script next to the <code>mod_test</code> folder. Call it “<code>module_import.py</code>”:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../media/file15.png" />

<p>Inside the script you will import the function “<code>test_function</code>” from the <code>example_module</code> script in the <code>mod_test</code> folder using the format below:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../media/file16.png" />
</figure>
<p>Scripts inside the module are accessed using dot notation (e.g. <code>mod_test.example_module</code>). The functions and classes inside the script called <code>example_module.py</code> are able to be imported by name.</p>
<p>Because the module is sitting next to the script that is importing the function, this import statement will work. But if you move your script and don’t copy the module to somewhere that is on the Python Path, it won’t be a successful import</p>
<p>That is because the way import statements work is based on the Python Path. This is a list of folder locations that Python will look for the module that you are requesting. By default, the first location is the local folder, meaning the folder containing your script. The next location is the site-packages folder.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-site-packages-folder" class="level3" data-number="2.4.9">
<h3 data-number="2.4.9">The site-packages folder</h3>
<p>Most modules are installed in a folder inside the Python folder. This is called the site-packages folder and it sits at <code>*/Lib/sites-packages</code>.</p>
<p>To make your module available to for import without needing it to be next to your script, put your module folder in the site-packages folder. When you run “<code>from mod_test.example_module import test_function</code>” it will locate the module called mod_test in the sites packages folder.</p>

<h3 data-number="2.5.1">Indentation</h3>
<p>Python code has strict indentation rules that are enforced by all IDEs. These rules relate to functions and loops especially.</p>
<p>As a standard, 4 spaces are used after a function is declared or a loop is created. This is just a standard, as it could be only one space, but that indentation level becomes important when scripts get big and it helps to have 4 spaces for all indented lines so that they can be more easily read.</p>
<p>It is encouraged to not mix tabs and spaces when indenting.</p>

<section id="add-a-comment-at-the-top-with-script-details" class="level4" data-number="2.5.1.1">
<h4 data-number="2.5.1.1">Add a comment at the top with script details</h4>
<p>This is an optional but recommended way to start your scripts: write a comment at the top with your name, the date, and some quick explanation about what the script is supposed to do. This is especially nice when other people have to read your code.</p>
<p>Add lots of other comments throughout the script as well, to make sure you know what is happening throughout the script.</p>

<section id="follow-with-import-statements" class="level4" data-number="2.5.1.2">
<h4 data-number="2.5.1.2">Follow with Import statements</h4>
<p>It is encouraged but not required to put the import statements at or near the top of the script. Imports must happen before the module objects are called in the script, but the import statements can be placed anywhere. It is best to put them at the top so that people reading the script can understand what is being imported.</p>

<section id="define-global-variables" class="level3" data-number="2.5.2">
<h3 data-number="2.5.2">Define global variables</h3>
<p>After the import statements, define the necessary variables that will be used in this script. Sometimes it is necessary to define variables later in the script but it is best to put major variables near the top.</p>
</section>
<section id="define-functions" class="level3" data-number="2.5.3">
<h3 data-number="2.5.3">Define functions</h3>
<p>By placing function definitions below the global variables, it is easy to read and understand what the functions do when reading them. It is sometimes hard to find a function that is called in another part of the script if the function is not in a known location in the script.</p>
</section>
<section id="include-print-statements" class="level3" data-number="2.5.4">
<h3 data-number="2.5.4">Include print statements</h3>
<p>The built-in function called print is used to send messages from the script to the command window while the script is running. Pass any valid data to the print statement and use it to track progress or to debug if there are issues.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;blueberry&quot;)
blueberry
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 0
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(x)
0</code></pre>

<section id="write-the-executable-parts-of-the-script" class="level3" data-number="2.5.5">
<h3 data-number="2.5.5">Write the executable parts of the script</h3>
<p>After importing modules and defining functions, the next part of the script is where the action takes place. The for loops are run, the functions are called, and the script is then done.</p>
<p>Make sure to add lots of comments to help yourself understand what is happening throughout the script, and print statements as well to help while the script is running.</p>
</section>
<section id="if-__name__-__main__" class="level3" data-number="2.5.6">
<h3 data-number="2.5.6">If __name__ == ‘__main__’</h3>
<p>Often at the end of scripts you will see this line, <code>if __name__ == “__main__”</code>. What it means is that the indented code below this line will be run if the script is executed directly, but if the code in the script is imported by another script, the code will not execute until called in the second script.</p>

<h2 data-number="2.6">Summary</h2>
<p>In this chapter, we did a fast but comprehensive overview of computer programming and the Python programming language. We reviewed the basics of computer programming, including variables and iteration and conditionals. We reviewed the Windows Path environment variable and the Python system path. We explored the data types of Python, including Integers and Strings and Float, and the data containers of Python such as lists and tuples and dictionaries. We learned some basic code structure for scripts, and how to execute those scripts.</p>
<p>In the next chapter we will discuss the basics of <code>arcpy</code> and the ArcGIS API for Python. We will learn how to import these modules and access their methods and submodules. We will begin to execute Python code to automate ArcGIS Desktop and ArcGIS Pro.</p>
