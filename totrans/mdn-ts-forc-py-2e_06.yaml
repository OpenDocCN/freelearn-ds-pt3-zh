- en: In this part, we will be looking at ways of applying modern machine learning
    techniques for time series forecasting. This part also covers powerful forecast
    combination methods and the exciting new paradigm of global models. By the end
    of this part, you will be able to set up a modeling pipeline using modern machine
    learning techniques for time series forecasting.
