- en: Tableau applies many good visual practices by default, and, for quick analysis,
    you likely won't worry too much about changing many of these defaults. However,
    as you consider how to best communicate the data story you've uncovered, you'll
    want to consider how to leverage everything, from fonts and text, to colors and
    design, so that you can communicate well with your audience.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Tableau's formatting options give you quite a bit of flexibility. Fonts, titles,
    captions, colors, row and column banding, labels, shading, annotations, and much
    more, can all be customized to make your visualizations tell an impressive story.

    things to consider. We'll start with those considerations.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Tableau employs good practices for formatting and visualization from the time
    you start dropping fields on shelves. You'll find that the discrete palettes use
    colors that are easy to distinguish, the fonts are pleasant, the grid lines are
    faint where appropriate, and numbers and dates follow the default format settings
    defined in the metadata.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The default formatting is more than adequate for discovery and analysis. If
    your focus is analysis, you may not want to spend too much time fine-tuning the
    formatting until you are getting ready to share results. However, when you contemplate
    how you will communicate the data to others, you might consider how adjustments
    to the formatting can make a major difference to how well the data story is told.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes, you will have certain formatting preferences in mind or a set of
    corporate guidelines that dictate font and color selections. In these cases, you
    might set formatting options in a blank workbook and save it as a template. This
    workbook file could be copied in the file system any time you wished to begin
    a new set of views and dashboards.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Audience**: Who is the audience and what are the needs of the audience?'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Goal**: Is the goal to evoke an emotional response or to lay out the facts
    for an impassioned decision? Are you highlighting an action that needs to be taken,
    or simply trying to generate interest in a topic?'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Setting**: This is the environment in which the data story is communicated.
    Is it a formal business meeting where the format should reflect a high level of
    professionalism? Is it going to be shared on a blog informally?'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Mode**: How will the visualizations be presented? You''ll want to make sure
    rows, columns, fonts, and marks are large enough for a projector or compact enough
    for an iPad. If you are publishing to Tableau Server, Tableau Online, or Tableau
    Public, then did you select fonts that are safe for the web? Will you need to
    use the device designer to create different versions of a dashboard?'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Mood**: Certain colors, fonts, and layouts can be used to set a mood. Does
    the data tell a story that should invoke a certain response from your audience?
    Is the data story somber or playful? The color red, for example, may connote danger,
    negative results, or indicate that an action is required. However, you''ll need
    to be sensitive to your audience and the specific context. Colors have different
    meanings in different cultures and in different contexts. In some cultures, red
    might indicate joy or happiness. Also, red might not be a good choice to communicate
    negativity if it is the color of the corporate logo.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Consistency**: Generally, use the same fonts, colors, shapes, line thickness,
    and row-banding throughout all visualizations. This is especially true when they
    will be seen together on a dashboard or even used in the same workbook. You may
    also consider how to remain consistent throughout the organization without being
    too rigid.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These considerations will inform your design and formatting decisions. As with
    everything else you do with Tableau, think of design as an iterative process.
    Seek feedback from your intended audience often and adjust your practices as necessary
    to make sure your communication is as clear and effective as possible. The entire
    goal of formatting is to more effectively communicate the data.
