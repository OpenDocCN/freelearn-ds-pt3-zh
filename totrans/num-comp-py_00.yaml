- en: Data mining, or parsing the data to extract useful insights, is a niche skill
    that can transform your career as a data scientist Python is a flexible programming
    language that is equipped with a strong suite of libraries and toolkits, and gives
    you the perfect platform to sift through your data and mine the insights you seek.
    This Learning Path is designed to familiarize you with the Python libraries and
    the underlying statistics that you need to get comfortable with data mining.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You will learn how to use Pandas, Python's popular library to analyze different
    kinds of data, and leverage the power of Matplotlib to generate appealing and
    impressive visualizations for the insights you have derived. You will also explore
    different machine learning techniques and statistics that enable you to build
    powerful predictive models.
