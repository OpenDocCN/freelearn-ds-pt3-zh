			<p>Python is a powerful and flexible programming language that is fun and easy to learn. It is the programming language of choice for many professionals, hobbyists, and scientists. The power of Python comes from its large ecosystem of packages and a friendly community, and its ability to communicate seamlessly with compiled extension modules. This means that Python is ideal for solving problems of all kinds, especially mathematical problems.</p>
			<p>Mathematics is usually associated with calculations and equations but, in reality, these are very small parts of a much larger subject. At its core, mathematics is about solving problems, and the logically structured approach to solutions. Once you explore past the equations, calculations, derivatives, and integrals, you discover a vast world of beautiful, elegant structures.</p>
			<p>This book is an introduction to solving mathematical problems using Python. It introduces some of the basic concepts of mathematics and how to use Python to work with these concepts. It also introduces some basic templates for solving a variety of mathematical problems across a large number of topics within mathematics. The first few chapters focus on core skills such as working with NumPy arrays, plotting, calculus, and probability. These topics are very important throughout mathematics and act as a foundation for the rest of the book. In the remaining chapters, we discuss more practical problems, covering topics such as data analysis and statistics, networks, regression and forecasting, optimization, and game theory. We hope that this book provides a basis for solving mathematical problems and the tools for you to further explore the world of mathematics.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book is primarily aimed at people who have some experience with Python and have projects (for work or just for fun) that involve solving some kind of mathematical problem. In the first few chapters we aim to give a small taste of the mathematical background for those who are not familiar with the basics, but we are rather limited by space. I’ve provided some suggestions for further reading at the end of each chapter to point you to resources where you can learn more. I hope that this book gets you started on your mathematical problems, and sparks your curiosity to learn more about the mathematics behind these subjects.</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
			<p>You will need to have a basic knowledge of Python. We don’t assume any knowledge of mathematics, although if you are familiar with some basic mathematical concepts, you will better understand the context and details of the techniques we discuss.</p>
			<p>The only requirement throughout this book is a recent version of Python – at least Python 3.6, but higher versions are preferable. (The code for this edition has been tested on Python 3.10, but should work on earlier versions too.) You might prefer to use the Anaconda distribution of Python, which comes with many of the packages and tools required in this book. If this is the case, you should use the <strong class="source-inline">conda</strong> package manager to install the packages. Python is supported on all major operating systems – Windows, macOS, and Linux – and on many platforms.</p>
			<p>The packages that are used in this book and their versions at the time of writing: NumPy 1.23.3, SciPy 1.9.1 Matplotlib 3.6.0, Jax 0.3.13 (and jaxlib 0.3.10), Diffrax 0.1.2, PyMC 4.2.2, pandas 1.4.3 Bokeh 2.4.3, NetworkX 3.5.3, Scikit-learn 1.1.2, StatsModels 0.13.2, Shapely 1.8.4, NashPy 0.0.35, Pint 0.20.1, Uncertainties 3.1.7, Xarray 2022.11.0, NetCDF4 1.6.1, Geopandas 0.12.1, CartoPy 0.21.0, Cerberus 1.3.4, Cython 0.29.32, Dask 2022.10.2. </p>

			<p>You may prefer to work through the code samples in this book in a Jupyter notebook rather than in a simple Python file. There are one or two places in this book where you might need to repeat plotting commands, as plots cannot be updated in later cells in the way that is shown here.</p>
