- en: pandas is a library for creating and manipulating structured data with Python.
    What do I mean by structured? I mean tabular data in rows and columns like what
    you would find in a spreadsheet or database. Data scientists, analysts, programmers,
    engineers, and others are leveraging it to mold their data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'pandas is limited to “small data” (data that can fit in memory on a single
    machine). However, the syntax and operations have been adopted by or inspired
    other projects: PySpark, Dask, and cuDF, among others. These projects have different
    goals, but some of them will scale out to big data. So, there is value in understanding
    how pandas works as the features are becoming the de facto API for interacting
    with structured data.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I, Will Ayd, have been a core maintainer of the pandas library since 2018\.
    During that time, I have had the pleasure of contributing to and collaborating
    on a host of other open source projects in the same ecosystem, including but not
    limited to Arrow, NumPy and Cython.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I also consult for a living, utilizing the same ecosystem that I contribute
    to. Using the best open source tooling, I help clients develop data strategies,
    implement processes and patterns, and train associates to stay ahead of the ever-changing
    analytics curve. I strongly believe in the freedom that open source tooling provides,
    and have proven that value to many companies.

- en: Who this book is for
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book contains a huge number of recipes, ranging from very simple to advanced.
    All recipes strive to be written in clear, concise, and modern idiomatic pandas
    code. The *How it works* sections contain extremely detailed descriptions of the
    intricacies of each step of the recipe. Often, in the *There’s more…* section,
    you will get what may seem like an entirely new recipe. This book is densely packed
    with an extraordinary amount of pandas code.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While not strictly required, users are advised to read the book chronologically.
    The recipes are structured in such a way that they first introduce concepts and
    features using very small, directed examples, but continuously build from there
    into more complex applications.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Due to the wide range of complexity, this book can be useful to both novice
    and everyday users alike. It has been my experience that even those who use pandas
    regularly will not master it without being exposed to idiomatic pandas code. This
    is somewhat fostered by the breadth that pandas offers. There are almost always
    multiple ways of completing the same operation, which can have users get the result
    they want but in a very inefficient manner. It is not uncommon to see an order
    of magnitude or more in performance difference between two sets of pandas solutions
    to the same problem.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The only real prerequisite for this book is a fundamental knowledge of Python.
    It is assumed that the reader is familiar with all the common built-in data containers
    in Python, such as lists, sets, dictionaries, and tuples.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are a couple of things you can do to get the most out of this book. First,
    and most importantly, you should download all the code, which is stored in Jupyter
    Notebook. While reading through each recipe, run each step of code in the notebook.
    Make sure you explore on your own as you run through the code. Second, have the
    pandas official documentation open ([http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/))
    in one of your browser tabs. The pandas documentation is an excellent resource
    containing over 1,000 pages of material. There are examples for most of the pandas
    operations in the documentation, and they will often be directly linked from the
    *See also* section. While it covers the basics of most operations, it does so
    with trivial examples and fake data that don’t reflect situations that you are
    likely to encounter when analyzing datasets from the real world.
