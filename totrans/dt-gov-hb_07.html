			<p>Establishing a <a id="_idIndexMarker432"/>high-value, high-<strong class="bold">return-on-investment</strong> (<strong class="bold">ROI</strong>) data lineage capability is a fundamental capability for any data governance program. The success or failure of a Chief Data &amp; Analytics Officer hinges on being able to answer a few key <span class="No-Break">core questions:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Where is <span class="No-Break">my data?</span></li>
				<li>Who <span class="No-Break">owns it?</span></li>
				<li>How is <span class="No-Break">it classified?</span></li>
				<li>Is the data safe <span class="No-Break">and secure?</span></li>
				<li>How does it change (or how was it changed) as it moves through <span class="No-Break">the company?</span></li>
				<li>Can I trust the data? Is it of <span class="No-Break">high quality?</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Data lineage<a id="_idIndexMarker433"/> is the ability to see the journey the data has taken across your organization. Data lineage captures the source of any transposition changes and the overall journey of where that data has come and gone. It provides a line of sight into how the data has evolved across its source, journey, <span class="No-Break">and evolution.</span></p>
			<p>Building on the Metadata Management capabilities outlined in <a href="B18846_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor134"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Metadata Management</em>, this chapter will focus on the more technical aspects of Metadata Management. We will focus on where the data is, how it’s moved, and the technical requirements to better understand the data. While technical data stewards are most likely to be engaging with technical metadata, specifically with data lineage, business data stewards also benefit from this capability. Additionally, technical metadata will provide the foundation for the measurement of data quality, which we will cover in <a href="B18846_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor170"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></span></a>, <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Data Quality</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>As of the time of this writing, full end-to-end data lineage is still a challenge for most companies. I will outline my experience in deploying data lineage, the challenges, and what we can do about it in lieu of perfection. We do not need to wait for the “magic bullet” tool or technology to lean into the development of data lineage capabilities for our companies. We can start right now with what we have and build as the capability matures. Let’s start with some basic definitions to ground ourselves in a <span class="No-Break">common language.</span></p>
			<p>We will cover the following <span class="No-Break">main topics:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Technical metadata</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Data lineage</span></li>
				<li>Building an optimal data <span class="No-Break">lineage capability</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-155"><a id="_idTextAnchor154"/>Technical Metadata</h1>
			<p><strong class="bold">Technical Metadata</strong> is<a id="_idIndexMarker434"/> typically used by more technical data professionals such as engineers, data operations professionals, system engineers, and general information technology analysts. Technical Metadata is information that describes the more technical aspects of data and includes key information to manage and understand the physical aspects of data. Technical Metadata includes location and formatting information across the <span class="No-Break">following areas:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data schema</strong>: The<a id="_idIndexMarker435"/> description of the structure of the database, including tables, rows/columns, and the relationship <span class="No-Break">between them</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data dictionary</strong>: Includes<a id="_idIndexMarker436"/> data definitions, data lineage, and data <span class="No-Break">quality rules</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data lineage</strong>: The <a id="_idIndexMarker437"/>history of how the data is created, processed, and used; it is used to enable data discovery, data integration, data governance, and <span class="No-Break">data analysis</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-156"><a id="_idTextAnchor155"/>Why does it matter? What matters?</h2>
			<p>Documentation of physical<a id="_idIndexMarker438"/> data assets, movement, transformations, and relationships between physical data elements enables the users to better understand the data. Technical metadata capabilities are important for several reasons, including <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Helping data analysts and engineers understand what data <span class="No-Break">is available</span></li>
				<li>Helping to track the history of how the data was created and transformed, which can be useful for debugging and <span class="No-Break">auditing purposes</span></li>
				<li>Can be used to assess the quality of the data to enable the users to identify and fix data quality issues, as well as identify where the data quality issue was introduced in the process (thereby enabling the business to fix the process issue that led to the data <span class="No-Break">quality issue)</span></li>
				<li>Protecting data <a id="_idIndexMarker439"/>from authorized access <span class="No-Break">and/or modification</span></li>

							<p>When you are getting started with technical metadata, you will likely need to pick one area to start with. You may want to start with a report that is important to your business so that you can provide assurance that the report is reliable. If this seems overwhelming, you might just start with a simple metric on <span class="No-Break">that report.</span></p>
							<p>For example, perhaps you are trying to understand if the customer count you are reporting to your stakeholders (and, perhaps, specifically stockholders) is accurate. Here are a few questions you might be asking about <span class="No-Break">that metric:</span></p>
							<ul>
								<li>What is the definition of <span class="No-Break">customer count?</span></li>
								<li>Where are we sourcing the customer count <span class="No-Break">metric from?</span></li>
								<li>Is the source the right place to source the customer count metric from, based on <span class="No-Break">our definition?</span></li>
								<li>What is the lineage of the customer count data? Who touches that data <span class="No-Break">in transit?</span></li>
								<li>Are we confident the customer count data is of high quality? Can we <span class="No-Break">trust it?</span></li>
								<li>Who is the owner of the customer <span class="No-Break">count metric?</span></li>
								<li>Have we tested the lineage to ensure that the data is reliable? Have we tested the data quality for accuracy, completeness, <span class="No-Break">and reliability?</span></li>
							</ul>
							<p>By evaluating the answers to this question, we will be able to determine if A) there are issues with the customer count metric or B) we are confident relying on it. By exploring the metric in detail and documenting the results in a shared system of record for metadata, we can reduce our dependency on institutional knowledge and create transparency and visibility into this metric. Once it is evaluated, we can reuse it across the company <span class="No-Break">with confidence.</span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-157"><a id="_idTextAnchor156"/>How do you measure the value?</h2>
			<p>I often <a id="_idIndexMarker440"/>get asked how to measure the value of the more technical aspects of data governance (in addition to data governance in general). The root of this question is: how do you measure the value in terms that business users will understand <em class="italic">and agree to</em>? The important part of this answer is that the business user must agree that the value they received is as you described. Most CDAOs do not go the extra step to gather confirmation from the business that they did indeed receive the value the data office says that they did. In this case, CDAOs are found advocating that their team provided impact, and no one is agreeing, often causing the CDAO to lose credibility with the business and, ultimately, funding <span class="No-Break">and support.</span></p>
			<p>To avoid this issue, it’s imperative that value is based on facts and that the business agrees with the facts upfront, before the deployment (often, this means aligning on the methodology by which value will be measured), aligning after the deployment of the capability that they did receive the value. There are several ways to measure the value of <span class="No-Break">technical metadata.</span></p>
			<p>The most <a id="_idIndexMarker441"/>straightforward way to measure the value is to start by measuring the benefits that technical metadata provides to <span class="No-Break">the organization:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>The reduction in time spent to find and understand data [<em class="italic"># of hours saved x the number of people impacted * average cost per hour/per person = Reduction in cost saved by providing </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">technical metadata</em></span><span class="No-Break">]</span><ul><li>Assumptions to align with the <span class="No-Break">business on:</span><ul><li># of <span class="No-Break">hours saved</span></li><li># of <span class="No-Break">people impacted</span></li><li>Cost <span class="No-Break">per hour/person</span></li></ul></li><li>Note: Align the assumptions upfront so that when the results come in, there is less debate. Often, the number is higher than they expect, and it provides concerns about the methodology. This approach will reduce the friction in value <span class="No-Break">alignment discussions.</span></li><li><em class="italic">Additional note</em>: I have seen the “search and find” time for an analyst <strong class="bold">reduce up to 80% by activating a metadata management capability in an organization</strong>, so do not understate the importance and impact of <span class="No-Break">this capability.</span></li></ul></li>
				<li>Improved quality and accuracy of data analysis [<em class="italic"># of identified data issues * value of data </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">issue remediation</em></span><span class="No-Break">]</span><ul><li>Assumptions to align with the <span class="No-Break">business on:</span><ul><li>Value of data issue remediation [could be the actual dollar amount, could be materiality %, could be the value of the decision made from <span class="No-Break">the number]</span></li></ul></li><li>Note: You could simply track the number of data issues identified and remediated; however, that assumes all data issues are treated equally, which is <span class="No-Break">not true.</span></li></ul></li>
			</ul>
			<p>An alternative or additive measurement of value is the measure of the cost avoidance that technical metadata provides to the organization. These tend to be a bit harder to define and align with the business but are equally as valuable. Here are <span class="No-Break">some examples:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Compliance violation avoidance (examples: GDPR fines, CCPA fines, external audit findings) [<em class="italic"># of violations avoided * average cost </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">of violation</em></span><span class="No-Break">]</span><ul><li>Assumptions to align with the <span class="No-Break">business on:</span><ul><li>Which violations were avoided (usually aligned with Chief Privacy, Chief Legal, or Chief <span class="No-Break">Compliance Officer(s))</span></li><li>The average cost <span class="No-Break">of violations</span></li></ul></li></ul></li>
				<li>Error avoidance [<em class="italic"># of errors avoided * Value </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">of avoidance</em></span><span class="No-Break">]</span><ul><li>Assumptions to align with the <span class="No-Break">business on:</span><ul><li>What is an <span class="No-Break">avoided error?</span></li><li>What’s the <a id="_idIndexMarker442"/>value of the <span class="No-Break">avoided error?</span></li></ul></li></ul></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Ideally, your technical metadata leader should track and report these metrics regularly. I recommend making the metrics stakeholder-facing, available for review at any time, and fully transparent. You can invite challenges from stakeholders regarding the assumptions to build trust in the metrics used to measure success, without being defensive. If the assumptions don’t make sense to the business, change them. Ensure alignment on the assumptions, and let the value of the solution speak for itself <span class="No-Break">from there.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-158"><a id="_idTextAnchor157"/>Which metrics should be used to measure maturity?</h2>
			<p>When <a id="_idIndexMarker443"/>evaluating the maturity of the technical metadata management capabilities, the following metrics should be used internally to measure the implementation of <span class="No-Break">the capability:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Number of data sources with data <span class="No-Break">schemas documented</span></li>
				<li>Number of data sources with <span class="No-Break">complete information</span></li>
				<li>Number of data sources with technical data <span class="No-Break">stewards identified</span></li>
				<li>Number of reports with technical <span class="No-Break">metadata documented</span></li>
				<li>Number of metrics with technical <span class="No-Break">metadata documented</span></li>
				<li>Number of <a id="_idIndexMarker444"/>data quality issues identified from <span class="No-Break">technical metadata</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="callout-heading">Example</p>
			<p class="callout"><em class="italic">Where is </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">our data?</em></span></p>
			<p class="callout">A common, and somewhat terrifying question to <span class="No-Break">be asked.</span></p>
			<p class="callout">What’s more terrifying is the common answer: <em class="italic">I </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">don’t know.</em></span></p>
			<p class="callout">This is the reality for most companies, unfortunately. Many have a “decent” idea of where the data is. They may know what system it’s in…but what about the unknowns? Are you 100% sure that the data hasn’t been copied? Replicated? Stored on <span class="No-Break">a spreadsheet?</span></p>
			<p class="callout">This is what makes technical metadata so important, to be able to answer the question, “<em class="italic">Where is my data?</em>” Many companies know where they expect data to be but struggle to have a complete picture of all of the locations of their data <span class="No-Break">with certainty.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-159"><a id="_idTextAnchor158"/>Who manages it?</h2>
			<p>Technical <a id="_idIndexMarker445"/>metadata should be managed by the <strong class="bold">Technical Data Steward</strong>. The Technical Data Steward<a id="_idIndexMarker446"/> is a technical resource within the organization, often within the Information Technology function, who is responsible for maintaining and caring for the physical data within your organization. While<a id="_idIndexMarker447"/> your <strong class="bold">Business Data Steward</strong> is responsible<a id="_idIndexMarker448"/> for policy compliance, business definitions, use, and business glossary accuracy, the Technical Data Steward is the technical counterpart to this Business Data Steward. Together, these two roles create trust in the data that is available to the company as a <span class="No-Break">company asset.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-160"><a id="_idTextAnchor159"/>What does maturity look like?</h2>
			<p>A mature, fully <a id="_idIndexMarker449"/>operationalized technical metadata solution will provide fully available, easily accessible, comprehensive technical information about the company’s data, with clear stewardship (which answers the question: <em class="italic">Who is accountable for the data?</em>). The data will be transparent, clear, and easily understood by any user. Additionally, the solution will answer the <span class="No-Break">following questions:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>What data do <span class="No-Break">we have?</span></li>
				<li>Where is our <span class="No-Break">data located?</span></li>
				<li>How is our data <span class="No-Break">being used?</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>When we can consistently and systematically answer these questions of our data, then we have a mature technical metadata capability. If we have to go on a search and rescue mission each time a question (such as the preceding ones) is asked, we have more work to do. It usually takes one crisis, either customer-driven or regulatory-driven, where you can’t easily answer the preceding questions to drive executive management to invest in this capability quickly and <span class="No-Break">at scale.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-161"><a id="_idTextAnchor160"/>How should you use it?</h2>
			<p>There are a number <a id="_idIndexMarker450"/>of ways a user (business or technical) can use technical metadata information to aid them in running their business and performing their respective job responsibilities. A few common examples include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">When you are looking for data</strong>. <em class="italic">Example</em>: A user is trying to find the best source of revenue for a <span class="No-Break">specific product.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">When you find a problem and want to understand the source of the issue</strong>. <em class="italic">Example</em>: The user identified there is an issue on a report. They look to the business and technical metadata to find where the data is coming from to discover the source of <span class="No-Break">the error.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">When you are trying to secure and protect data</strong>. <em class="italic">Example</em>: You need to find <strong class="bold">personally identifiable information</strong> (<strong class="bold">PII</strong>) in <a id="_idIndexMarker451"/>the company and protect it from unauthorized access. First, you need to find where the PII is so that you can classify it as PII, and then work with your security team to <span class="No-Break">protect it.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">When you need to delete data</strong>. <em class="italic">Example</em>: A new customer requirement to delete data within a specified time period is defined in their contract. They’ve asked the company to delete their data, and you need to find where all their data is in <span class="No-Break">the organization.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">When you are trying to understand a process end to end</strong>. <em class="italic">Example</em>: You are a business analyst, and you are looking for ways to optimize the lead-to-cash process. You want to understand the path a quote takes through the company’s systems to look for <span class="No-Break">simplification opportunities.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">When you are attempting to understand change management impacts</strong>. <em class="italic">Example</em>: A new release of your HR system is going into production this weekend. You<a id="_idIndexMarker452"/> need to determine if any of the reports used for headcount management are impacted by the changes before <span class="No-Break">they happen.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-162"><a id="_idTextAnchor161"/>Data Lineage</h1>
			<p><strong class="bold">Data </strong>L<strong class="bold">ineage</strong> is the<a id="_idIndexMarker453"/> capability that tracks and documents the journey data takes through an organization’s systems. Data lineage shows how data flows through the systems, how it is changed or manipulated along the journey, and where it is stored and ultimately used. In short, data lineage provides transparency into the data. This is critical because transparency helps us drive trust in our data. When we know what the data is and where it comes from, we trust it more, and it is a key component in understanding the data and believing what it <span class="No-Break">tells us.</span></p>
			<p>The other key component of a data lineage capability is it tracks the flow of data over time. Unlike some of the other data capabilities in this book, data lineage provides information about the data life cycle. By providing a clearer understanding of where data originated, how it may have been changed, and where it ultimately resides, we are able to see all the transformations the data went through along its life cycle, what changed, <span class="No-Break">and why.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-163"><a id="_idTextAnchor162"/>Why does it matter? What matters?</h2>
			<p>Having trust in<a id="_idIndexMarker454"/> our data is paramount to ensuring a company is making data-driven decisions. At the last assessment, 83% of CEOs wanted their organizations to be data-driven, but only 30% of employees believed that they were (<em class="italic">Tableau</em>). Why the gap? Well, in part, because the data is not trusted, it’s hard to get to, people do not understand it, and, therefore, it’s considered in decisions but rarely used. Data lineage matters because it helps companies to see the data more clearly, understand where it came from, and, thus, trust it. This trust is foundational to data use. When we trust information, we can use it for decision-making, and, therefore, make better decisions. Ultimately, <em class="italic">data lineage brings integrity </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">to data</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>Data lineage is the documentation of physical data assets, movement, transformations, and relationships between physical data elements. Data lineage tells us <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Where the <span class="No-Break">data is</span></li>
				<li>How it’s stored (is it in a data warehouse, data lake, on-premises, or in the cloud (<span class="No-Break">which cloud)?)</span></li>
				<li>How the data <span class="No-Break">was created</span></li>
				<li>Where the data <span class="No-Break">came from</span></li>
				<li>When it was <span class="No-Break">last altered</span></li>
				<li>How it was updated (systematically, by a human, and determining which one by capturing the <span class="No-Break">user ID)</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="callout-heading">Example</p>
			<p class="callout">In one of my past experiences building out a Data Governance function, I had a consulting partner tell me that there was no need for end-to-end lineage so long as we could verify that the quality of the data at origination matched the quality of data at the output at the report. All that might be true for data quality purposes, but that doesn’t tell us about any technical implications associated with change management for security purposes, and <span class="No-Break">so on.</span></p>
			<p class="callout">For example, if a change goes into production in System A, and the reports we are looking at come out of System D, we would not have visibility into the interim stops at System B or System C. Without data lineage, we would not be able to see that System B contains that data and is a potential impact from a change. This is simply one system that the data transfers through as a part of its journey. We would simply see that System A and D did not match, but not know that data from System B is extracted into a different report and is also impacted in the <span class="No-Break">change process.</span></p>
			<p class="callout">Data lineage also provides us insight into what kinds of changes might impact it. Imagine being able to query our data lineage repository. We can see where that data lives across its life cycle, not just at its beginning and respective end. It’s important to consider all of the requirements for data lineage and all the use cases associated with it when making these types <span class="No-Break">of decisions.</span></p>
			<p>The benefits of data<a id="_idIndexMarker455"/> lineage are broad, as we will explore in the following sections. Please keep in mind that data lineage is the foundation for additional data governance capabilities, including data quality. We will cover data quality in great detail in <a href="B18846_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor170"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></span></a>, <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Data Quality</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-164"><a id="_idTextAnchor163"/>How do you measure the value?</h2>
			<p>Consistent with the<a id="_idIndexMarker456"/> measures in the <em class="italic">Technical Metadata</em> section, the value of data lineage can be measured in terms of cost savings, time savings, risk avoidance, and value add. See the preceding section for specific examples and calculations you can use to measure the value of data lineage. More broadly, data lineage can be measured in a variety of ways, including <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Increased revenue/cost savings</strong>: If you provide better information to the users, they are able to make better decisions about how to spend money, and thus generate revenue. This can also be leveraged to increase operating margin, by evaluating opportunities to reduce redundancies and cut costs. Costs can also be saved by identifying data errors early and preventing users from making decisions based on <span class="No-Break">bad data.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Risk reduction</strong>: You may be able to help save your company from the risk of a data breach by identifying data that carries risk and protecting <span class="No-Break">it early.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Improved decision-making</strong>: By using data lineage to provide a clear line of sight into the data, you can apply automation techniques to make reports quicker and higher value so that decisions can be made faster and with less human <span class="No-Break">error risk.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Increased/improved innovation</strong>: You can use data lineage to uncover new insights from existing data, which<a id="_idIndexMarker457"/> can be used to create new products <span class="No-Break">and services.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Broadly speaking, data lineage is valuable for a number of key reasons, including <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Increased data quality</strong>: Data lineage feeds data quality by providing insight into changes to the data to identify <span class="No-Break">potential errors.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Increased compliance</strong>: Data lineage helps companies meet compliance expectations that require an understanding of data sovereignty and support avoidance of fines or penalties for requirements such as GDPR <span class="No-Break">or CCPA.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Enhanced auditing</strong>: Data lineage enhances auditing capabilities due to the availability of data flows. By being able to see transparently where data has flowed, data lineage can help auditors understand a process before they have to meet <span class="No-Break">with stakeholders.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Improved security</strong>: Data lineage is a fundamental capability to drive precision in security practices. Instead of taking a blanket approach, a deep understanding of the data that needs to be protected allows security teams to act with precision, applying the appropriate level of control to the right data in <span class="No-Break">the organization.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Faster troubleshooting</strong>: Data lineage can be used to investigate data issues to be able to trace the data throughout the data supply chain. This traceability will help the user identify the source of the issue faster, saving (potentially <span class="No-Break">significant) time.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Improved change management</strong>: Data lineage drives improved change management by enabling teams to see what data will be impacted by a release or change ahead of time so that appropriate testing can be completed ahead of production releases and after to confirm changes are functioning <span class="No-Break">as intended.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Stronger data governance</strong>: Data lineage can be used to improve data governance and assist in the prioritization of efforts. By providing a systematic way to document data flow, the data governance team can leverage data lineage to prioritize focus areas and ensure data is used in a consistent and compliant manner aligned with data <span class="No-Break">governance policy.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Leveraging the areas outlined here, you can use a basic calculation to measure the value of data lineage all in by calculating the aforementioned benefits, and then using a simple <span class="No-Break">ROI calculation:</span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">ROI = </strong><strong class="bold">(</strong><strong class="bold">Benefits − Costs</strong><strong class="bold">)</strong><strong class="bold"> / </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Costs</strong></span></p>
			<p>You can calculate the ROI on your data lineage capability for the company. To calculate costs to serve this capability, you should include the <span class="No-Break">following costs:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Cost of the software</strong>: Cost of the contract to acquire the data lineage tool or tools used in your organization to provide the capability <span class="No-Break">to users.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Costs of the implementation (over some period of time)</strong>: The cost to implement the tool may include one-time costs such as an implementation consultant and increased headcount (such as contractors to stand up the platform or tooling needed to design processes or do initial data <span class="No-Break">lineage collection).</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Cost of the maintenance, including people, processes, and technology</strong>: Cost for the people who will provide the capability on an ongoing basis, ongoing server<a id="_idIndexMarker458"/> space, and <span class="No-Break">so on.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Together, this calculation can value the benefit in terms of cost and provide your company with confidence that the work to maintain data lineage is overshadowed by the significant benefits <span class="No-Break">it provides.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-165"><a id="_idTextAnchor164"/>What metrics should be used to measure maturity?</h2>
			<p>In addition <a id="_idIndexMarker459"/>to business value measurements outlined previously, the data governance team may track specific value measurements program-wide, such as <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Number of data quality issues identified <span class="No-Break">and resolved</span></li>
				<li>Number of compliance violations identified and prevented before impacting <span class="No-Break">a customer</span></li>
				<li>Number of security incidents identified <span class="No-Break">and prevented</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Time to market</strong> (<strong class="bold">TTM</strong>) for <a id="_idIndexMarker460"/>new products <span class="No-Break">or services</span></li>
				<li>Increase in <strong class="bold">time to value</strong> (<strong class="bold">TTV</strong>) for <a id="_idIndexMarker461"/><span class="No-Break">data analytics</span></li>
				<li>Cost savings from data source retirement or <span class="No-Break">simplification efforts</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-166"><a id="_idTextAnchor165"/>Who manages it?</h2>
			<p>As with other types of technical metadata (such as a data dictionary), the Technical Data Steward<a id="_idIndexMarker462"/> is <a id="_idIndexMarker463"/>often the responsible person (or people) who cares for data lineage and ensures the lineage accurately represents the physical data throughout the company. A business user may use the data lineage to evidence confidence in the data, given visibility into where the data has moved, the quality along the journey, and the overall reliability of the data; however, the care of data lineage is typically in the hands of the Technical <span class="No-Break">Data Steward.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-167"><a id="_idTextAnchor166"/>What does maturity look like?</h2>
			<p>There are a number of<a id="_idIndexMarker464"/> mature data lineage capabilities that are relevant, but simply, the breadth and depth of your data lineage capability is the primary indicator of success. As you start to roll out this capability, you may start with a single report or metric. Next, you may evolve to an entire data domain or suite of systems. Last, you may have all prioritized data assets across the company documented with sustainable data lineage. As you mature, you should be able to uncover problems and errors in your data lineage through validation. Validation is a best practice that should be implemented along your maturity journey. The validation should include connecting data supplies and data consumers to confirm the results are as expected. Let’s explore <span class="No-Break">validation deeper.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Best practice – validating lineage</p>
			<p class="callout">By conducting end-to-end lineage, data analysts and business users can increase the trust of the data lineage capability. Validation provides confidence in the completeness and accuracy of the technical <span class="No-Break">metadata capabilities.</span></p>
			<p>To validate lineage, select a <a id="_idIndexMarker465"/>report that matters to your company; perhaps an executive-level dashboard with <strong class="bold">key performance indicators</strong> (<strong class="bold">KPIs</strong>) would be a<a id="_idIndexMarker466"/> good selection. Then, do <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Prioritize the relevant report and identify key business elements (data points) on <span class="No-Break">the report.</span></li>
				<li>Select a sample of line items to validate from <span class="No-Break">the report.</span></li>
				<li>Meet with the individual who either produces the report or is responsible for the automation to create the report (depending on how the report <span class="No-Break">is created).</span></li>
				<li>Document the end-to-end generation of the line items/key business elements identified in <em class="italic">steps 1</em> and <em class="italic">2</em> for each unique business <span class="No-Break">element selected.</span></li>
				<li>Identify any issues or concerns with the <span class="No-Break">documentation provided.</span></li>
				<li>Compare the narrative to the technical data lineage collected and assess <span class="No-Break">any gaps.</span></li>
				<li>Discuss with the report owner/producer any gaps identified, validate if the understanding or the technical lineage is inaccurate, reeducate for understanding gaps, and update technical lineage for any <span class="No-Break">technical gaps.</span></li>

			<p class="callout-heading">Best practice – linking technical metadata to business metadata</p>
			<p class="callout">To bring the power of business and technical metadata together, we must be able to link the two together. Ideally, your business and technical data stewards will work together to drive this capability so that the company can benefit from the <span class="No-Break">work done.</span></p>

			<p>Upon<a id="_idIndexMarker467"/> scoping a specific data asset into the metadata management capability, your business data steward will work to define business definitions and calculations and identify the appropriate, optimal source of the data. Then, the technical data steward will step in to identify physical data elements and extract the technical metadata (or read the technical metadata, depending on your tooling). The details about the physical data elements and the data supply chain should be reviewed and validated for quality, consistency, <span class="No-Break">and accuracy.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Best practice – optimizing the data journey</p>
			<p class="callout">By leveraging data lineage, the data team can identify data duplication enterprise-wide. When we have visibility into all the hops, skips, and jumps data takes across the data supply chain, we can identify inefficiencies across the supply chain. This allows us to identify places where the data can move more directly, reducing the risk of error and optimizing costs to maintain the same data in <span class="No-Break">multiple locations.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-168"><a id="_idTextAnchor167"/>How should you use Data Lineage?</h2>
			<p>Ideally, individuals<a id="_idIndexMarker468"/> should start with their question. What often happens is a data engineer or business analyst will start with something such as, “<em class="italic">I need access to database ABC</em>.” I always find this to be the wrong place to start, but it’s <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">so common</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>My immediate response is “<em class="italic">Why?</em>” and is often met with a <span class="No-Break">confused look.</span></p>
			<p>It’s not uncommon for the response to be something along the lines of “Because I need to do my job”, “I need to produce a dashboard”, or “My boss asked me to get some data to create <span class="No-Break">an insight.”</span></p>
			<p>The problem with this line of thinking is that we are putting the data before the business understanding, and it’s based on a series of assumptions about the data. In reality, what we should do is clarify the outcome we are searching for before we start asking for access to any data. Starting with “<em class="italic">Why?</em>” results in a much more specific and faster outcome. It allows the requester to think more deeply about why they are doing what they are doing and enables the data team to support them with a faster path to that answer because it is based on what they need versus where they want to start their search. This “give me access” approach is based on the assumption that the requester knows the location they are requesting access to is the best place to get the most trustworthy version of the data <span class="No-Break">they need.</span></p>
			<p>It’s <span class="No-Break">often wrong.</span></p>
			<p>Pulling on the previous example, if access were to be granted to the database requested, without further dialog, the requestor would get access to the data and go about their merry way. However (and I can’t stress this enough), it’s likely that there is more to the request and more to the data than initially believed. There are a few things that could go <a id="_idIndexMarker469"/>wrong in <span class="No-Break">this example:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>The database may not have the data in it that the requester believes <span class="No-Break">it does</span></li>
				<li>The data might not be fit <span class="No-Break">for use</span></li>
				<li>The data may have <span class="No-Break">low quality</span></li>
				<li>The database might not be the best place to get the data as it may not <span class="No-Break">be certified</span></li>
				<li>The analysis the requestor needs may already be readily available (the metric, the dataset, or perhaps <span class="No-Break">a report)</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Thus, the first step in any search for technical metadata should begin with the business metadata: specifically, the business glossary (see <a href="B18846_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor134"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Metadata Management</em> for more information on business glossaries). I encourage you to go back to the requester and ask, “<em class="italic">What question are you trying </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">to answer?</em></span><span class="No-Break">”</span></p>
			<p>For example, the requester may have been asking for access to a finance database in order to gather information about revenue for a specific product. They wanted access to the database so that they could query the database for the data they needed. However, in this example, what they may not know is that your team already produces a certified dashboard with revenue by product that is available in the Data Marketplace (see <a href="B18846_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor134"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Metadata Management</em> for more on Data Marketplaces). You can save the requester a lot of time and risk of producing inconsistent information by showing them the Data Marketplace and how they can more easily find what <span class="No-Break">they need.</span></p>
			<p>Because your<a id="_idIndexMarker470"/> Data Marketplace is full of certified, tested, and trusted data assets, the requestor can easily search for and find the data they need to answer their question. In this example, the requestor can locate the <strong class="bold">Revenue by Product</strong> dashboard and use the existing filters to sort by the time horizon they are interested in, with the additional comfort that the data is certified, validated, and trustworthy. <span class="No-Break">Everyone wins.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-169"><a id="_idTextAnchor168"/>Building an optimal Data Lineage capability</h1>
			<p>Now that we <a id="_idIndexMarker471"/>understand more about data lineage, what it looks like, who is involved, and the benefits, let’s explore how to build an optimal data lineage capability for your organization. First, you need to assess the complexity of your organization. Are you a large, highly regulated industry or are you a small, single-product company? Not every organization will need a fully robust, state-of-the-art data lineage. You may also start by building data lineage manually to prove the capability before investing hundreds of thousands, if not more, into a more <span class="No-Break">robust tool.</span></p>
			<p>Prioritize the scope of your implementation. Begin with a single report or single metric as a pilot and prove the capability. Gather a small group of individuals who are a part of the production of this report and help them understand the value of understanding the journey of data across the organization to produce their report or metric. Trace the data’s journey, identify opportunities for simplicity and remediation of issues, and measure the quality of <span class="No-Break">the data.</span></p>
			<p>Show the benefits of the pilot widely across the organization. Better yet, have the report or metric owner tell this story on your behalf. Have them share how their job has been simplified and/or improved because of this capability. Your next challenge will be to prioritize those who will step forward, wanting the same benefits seen in <span class="No-Break">the pilot.</span></p>
			<p>This is a great time to discuss and prioritize <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Why you should have full end-to-end lineage (and for which <span class="No-Break">use cases)</span></li>
				<li>Why you<a id="_idIndexMarker472"/> should <em class="italic">not</em> have full end-to-end lineage <span class="No-Break">and alternatives</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Not every data element enterprise-wide needs full lineage. You will need to prioritize the data assets that matter most. Remember the ROI calculation, and focus on the biggest ROI cases. The best approach for your organization will depend on the size and complexity of your data landscape and the resources available to make it a success. Start small and scale <span class="No-Break">from there.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-170"><a id="_idTextAnchor169"/>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>As you work to deploy a strong technical metadata capability within your organization, it helps to work in concert with your business metadata capability. As you are working to progress this capability across programs or data domains, having your data catalog updated as you go, defining key data elements, and aligning with technical metadata, including lineage, will help you build confidence in the quality of both business and technical metadata. Being able to show your users that you have both business and technical depth of understanding that is reliable will translate into strong reliance on your capabilities. Remember to start by defining the scope to help set expectations regarding what the business will get from this capability, and when. Ensure you have clear roles and responsibilities, along with clear, transparent, and published metrics to measure your success. Lastly, don’t forget to tell stories of success as <span class="No-Break">you go.</span></p>
