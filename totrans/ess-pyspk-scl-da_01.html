			<p>This section introduces the uninitiated to the Distributed Computing paradigm and shows how Spark became the de facto standard for big data processing.</p>
			<p>Upon completion of this section, you will be able to ingest data from various data sources, cleanse it, integrate it, and write it out to persistent storage such as a data lake in a scalable and distributed manner. You will also be able to build real-time analytics pipelines and perform change data capture in a data lake. You will understand the key differences between the ETL and ELT ways of data processing, and how ELT evolved for the cloud-based data lake world. This section also introduces you to Delta Lake to make cloud-based data lakes more reliable and performant. You will understand the nuances of Lambda architecture as a means to perform simultaneous batch and real-time analytics and how Apache Spark combined with Delta Lake greatly simplifies Lambda architecture.</p>
			<p>This section includes the following chapters:</p>
