    Even with a clear purpose, milestones, and great execution, the approach to launch
    will determine the success (or failure) of the program. The importance of the
    launch cannot be underscored enough. As we embark on *Part 3* of this book, we
    will walk through how to create simple and strong core messaging to engage and
    clearly articulate to the stakeholder community what and how the delivery will
    be accomplished. Then, I will lead you through the creation of a launch plan,
    a design of feedback loops to ensure continuous improvement, and finally, how
    to report on an ongoing basis for impact.

    the knowledge from the last 11 chapters and guide you through translating the
    information into a true data governance transformation. Be mindful that understanding
    the capabilities outlined to this point in this book is one thing, but turning
    the information into a successful data governance transformational program is
    another. Some of the best technical data governance leaders struggle with this
    translation into impact, because “being technical” is not enough. It is the basic
    requirement to be a data expert. However, without the ability to bring others
    along the journey with you, and translate it into impactful business outcomes,
    you will not be successful.

- en: As you embark on your journey to launch a data governance transformation, it’s
    so important that you get the early launch plan right. The focus of this chapter
    will walk you through this critical step. As a data leader, or a business leader,
    or if you are sponsoring a data leader, it’s your job to ensure that the business
    deeply understands, is bought into, and will stand behind the data transformation
    for the duration of the program. Given that most data governance transformations
    take anywhere between 24 and 36 months, getting the entirety of the company to
    stand behind you for the long haul is of utmost importance. Some key capabilities,
    such as the primary data of management, data operations, and target architecture,
    will take far longer to deliver on the return on investment than others. Therefore,
    it is important to launch powerfully, which includes delivering quick wins (which
    we will dig into in [*Chapter 13*](B18846_13.xhtml#_idTextAnchor264)).

    future state vision that allows the company to visualize what the future will
    be like once a data governance transformation has been completed. As a data professional,
    you know that data work is never done. Much like getting into shape after a long
    period without exercise, there is a hill to climb. However, once you’ve climbed
    the hill, you can’t stop exercising. No, you must keep exercising to maintain
    your level of fitness.

    implementation) to drive the capabilities outlined in *Chapters 6* to *11* into
    your company’s DNA. Not just once, but in a sustainable way. This is the “getting
    into shape” part of the program. Beyond the transformation, you will maintain
    the company’s level of “data fitness” through ongoing data practice, much like
    you would maintain a level of physical fitness. Your company should not be the
    same after you deliver your transformation.

    No, I don’t mean from a data management maturity perspective, but the business
    readiness. If you head into your launch plan assuming that the business is more
    ready to change than you assessed it to be, you will face resistance and will
    be frustrated early. If you underappreciate the readiness, you might find yourself
    selling it on a transformation it is already bought into. This can be equally
    as bad. If the business isn’t ready, you might be pushing for change they don’t
    think they need. If it is beyond ready, you’ll be talking about change when they
    are already wanting to see the change happening. You lose credibility and support
    in both scenarios. That’s why assessing the readiness is so important.

    let’s spend a moment reflecting upon the state of your organization. Plot the
    answers to the preceding questions here, so you can come back to reference them
    as we work through this chapter together on the following charts. The answers
    to these five questions do not necessarily mean your company is not ready—they
    are simply indicators as to the approach you need to take as you prepare to launch
    powerfully.

    but any answer is not a deal breaker. If you have an established data function,
    it is a consideration but having one isn’t a barrier to get started. You can use
    the lack of a central function to drive investment in one, or to drive centralization
    if needed. If there is a central function already in place, you may be able to
    move faster to drive transformation. Therefore, when it comes to establishing
    your transformational program, having the team in place will help you to get down
    the path of transformation faster.

- en: No one will argue with you, but having trusted data is no longer a *nice to
    have* but a requirement for any company. When you have high trust in data, it
    is a signal that the executive team not only relies on data for business decisions
    but also believes that the data they used to make those decisions is reliable.
    Not having trust in data shows up in a number of ways, including inconsistent
    information at the executive level, questions about the validity of the information,
    a clear lack of capabilities, data, and data quality, and ultimately, low trust
    in the data function.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When trust is low, painting a picture of a world where trust in data is not
    the exception but the norm can be very compelling. A great and simple use case
    is to ask your executive team which metrics (KPIs or OKRs) they use to measure
    the success of the company. Then ask how confident they are in the numbers. Is
    the executive team aligned that these metrics are correct and reliable? Do you
    trust them?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most companies will tell you that they do not have alignment in the most critical
    metrics. Or, they will say they are confident in the number their team is responsible
    for but not others. This signals a low trust in data and can be a great use case
    to start with.

    is the fitness of your established capabilities in place prior to launching a
    data transformation. Prior to launch, assess the state of established data governance
    capabilities. Regardless of centralization, does your organization have councils,
    stewardship in place, Meta, date of management, capabilities, data, quality, primary
    data of management, or data operations? If yes, to what extent are these capabilities
    mature and available for use across the organization? Are they highly adopted?
    If yes, then you have a leg up on launching your program. Simply having these
    capabilities gets you off to a strong start in transforming the way in which they
    are utilized in support of strong data enablement.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, not having established data management capabilities does not prevent
    you from launching a program. It’s simply means that you need to build the capabilities
    as you transform the organization at large. As with the preceding factors, neither
    strong nor weak data governance capabilities will prevent you from launching powerfully;
    it is simply something to be aware of as you determine the degree of transformation
    that is required for your company.

    use your data management maturity scores to bring awareness of the state of data
    governance at your company. A lower data management maturity score can help drive
    transparency and awareness to your executives regarding the true, unbiased state
    of data capabilities. This is a purer measure of the state of your organization
    versus simply assessing the existence of capabilities and the previous factor
    because data management maturity takes into consideration how embedded these capabilities
    are in day-to-day operations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you have a high data management maturity score, meaning a level of 4 or 5,
    it is unlikely that you need to do a significant data management transformation
    enterprise-wide. It may mean that you have focused pockets of improvement to deliver.
    Most companies remain somewhere between a 3 and a 3.5 on the data management maturity
    scale, although it varies based on industry. Financial services and healthcare,
    for example, tend to be more mature than other industries. The reason for this
    is the more intensive regulation around the control and protection of data.

    and analytics officer? Do you have an executive sponsor? Do you have a path to
    secure ongoing funding? Do you have the support of your C-suite? If you do not
    have these things, gathering support to drive a data transformation will be very
    difficult. You may need to select a smaller program or project to focus on to
    drive credibility and visibility at the most senior levels of your organization
    as a first step. However, if you are fortunate enough to have senior leaders supporting
    you with funding in place or the opportunity to secure funding for a data transformation,
    then you are in a great position to launch a powerful data management transformation
    for your company. Most chief data and analytics officers would greatly desire
    to have this kind of support.

    was a difficult reporting process that required consistency and primary data to
    allow for some of the most complicated regulatory reporting to occur. We started
    out by finding a couple of really good examples of what it took in the present
    state to complete this regulatory required reporting process. By fully understanding
    the efforts that it took to do large scale enterprise reporting, we were able
    to identify that there were hundreds of people manually touching the data in order
    to create a single report. A large amount of the manual intervention was in rationalizing
    data across systems that didn’t align systematically. It required manual intervention.

    what a future state could be if we implemented common reference data and published

    reference status sets enabled the inconsistencies to be remediated. It allowed
    for a dramatically simplified and much more automated process to support this
    data aggregation work across the organization at large. By showing this use case
    across the company to several executives, including the chief financial officer,
    the chief risk officer, and the chief data officer, we were able to get there

    not only serve as the backdrop for all that you will do but also shows any audience
    that you have a well-thought-out plan. I recommend you aim to keep this memo under
    10 pages. It will force you to go into enough detail to explain what you will
    deliver, why, and how you will measure success without becoming overly verbose.

    write it. It sounds obvious, but many executives fail to move from pictures into
    a full description of the strategy. A memo is great for two reasons: it helps
    you fully crystalize your strategy and it defines the future state in a very specific
    way. It forces you to think through the details and refine the messaging clearly.
    In a picture or a slide, you have more liberty to skirt the details, whereas in
    a narrative, you are forced to be more thoughtful and specific.'

    I recommend that you really take the opportunity to think through this as it will
    set the tone for the next few years of work; however, you should set an expectation
    that the document is living and will be updated regularly (at least annually)
    to ensure it continues to enable the company’s strategy.'
