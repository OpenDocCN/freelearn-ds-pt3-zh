- en: As you launch your data transformation program, your team will quickly and consistently
    deliver results. Because of the nature of data governance, and skeptics of the
    practice of data translating into real, measurable results, you will need to shorten
    the time to first value as much as possible, and crisply and consistently show
    progress. In this chapter, I will walk you through how to create momentum with
    quick wins, how to communicate these wins effectively to and with the business,
    and how to ensure the business stakeholders understand how your results translate
    into their success.

    platforms often lose stakeholder interest by the time their results are realized.
    You can’t wait until your platforms or capabilities are launched to claim victory.
    In my experience, big-bang solutions are critical, but they can’t be everything.
    No stakeholder group or company will wait 18-24 months to see results on their
    data investments. Results have to happen in bite-sized moments while you simultaneously
    deliver incremental results.

    of this chapter), the average tenure of a chief data and analytics officer is
    approximately two and a half years, compared to other C-suite executives’ average
    tenure of approximately five years. Because of this, it is critical that you show
    you can deliver sustainable, measurable success. Your success in the role depends
    on it. As you begin with this pressure in mind, do not let it paralyze you, but
    rather, use it for fuel. Be mindful that you must consistently show up, every
    day, and demonstrate impact.

    What will that mean? What’s worthwhile for your stakeholders versus what is important
    to you? I recommend you start by answering these questions for you and your team.
    Hiring is an example of something you will need to do but it isn’t a “win” in
    the eyes of your stakeholders. Fixing a long-standing data quality issue that
    is causing executive-level metric errors, however, is a win that you should celebrate
    and communicate. So, what does it take to identify a quick win? We’ll start there.

    *Aligning on Outcomes*. It is critical that you measure the impact of the results
    you deliver. For example, in the purchase history example we went through earlier,
    we identified unbilled revenue that customers had committed to renewing but hadn’t
    been renewed by sales. In the example, from the financial transactions and order
    forms, we were able to identify the years of commitment, what had already been
    billed and paid, and what had not been billed and paid. The unbilled commitments
    were able to be measured and aggregated. The unbilled revenue totaled in the millions
    of dollars.

    and executive management, we were able to state very concretely that the team
    had identified the specific dollar amount of unbilled revenue. As sales took that
    data and followed up with customers, most were very happy to pay for the services,
    but no one had asked them to. They also were unaware. I have heard this exact
    same example play out in numerous other companies.

    often find funding their programs much easier to do than when measuring results
    is less direct, or when there is not a direct revenue or operational savings tie.
    If you can, measure results specifically and share very clearly. Obtain your stakeholders’
    support for the number you identify and go together to executive management to
    share the outcomes. This will bolster your credibility and partnerships. Now that

    of your team is to establish effective and easy-to-understand policies, standards,
    and procedures. In my experience, some of your stakeholders will simply want to
    be able to self-deliver. I think this is a great signal. It means that you have
    highly qualified data professionals across your organization who want to be able
    to get started. However, if they are looking to your team to tell them what to
    do, how to do it, and how they want to do it in alignment with your team, then
    these are engaged stakeholders.

    are seeking. The easiest way to do this is to publish guidelines that they can
    use. While some of your data engineers and analytics professionals are delivering
    on other quick wins, focused on the more technical components of data governance,
    other team members can concurrently be focusing on delivering these documents,
    which can support the broader enterprise.
  prefs: []

    and not overly complex policies, standards, and procedures is a great way to engage
    the entire company in data without a significantly sized team. Simply providing
    templates is a very easy way to engage your stewardship community on how to best
    document simple controls, define how to measure and report on the state of data
    quality, or perform simple data operations.

    policies, standards, and procedures cut wide across your organization. By marrying
    a technical solution with a more generalized solution, such as a simple data policy,
    you will gain support from a few different stakeholder groups. This is another
    way to build effective momentum in your data program while enabling the company
    to know what they need to do and how they need to do it. After publishing policies,
    standards, and procedures, and delivering a data governance capability, one of
    the next best steps that you can take is to define clear data ownership. By assigning
    data owners, you can operationalize your data governance in a federated model
    that will deliver accountability across the enterprise.

    just about your direct reporting staff, but also the entire data community across
    the company. One of the most important considerations in building a high-performing
    team is activating those who manage the data directly. These data stewards (both

    wins! The individuals closest to the data are the ones who see and experience
    the data issues day to day, and thus, are your biggest source of input when it

    more broadly to solutions holistically. The following image provides a visual
