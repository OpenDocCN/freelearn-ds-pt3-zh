- en: Plotly's Dash framework allows Python programmers to develop complete analytic
    data apps and interactive dashboards. This book will help you explore the functionalities
    of Dash for visualizing data in different ways and getting the most out of your
    data.

- en: You'll start with an overview of the Dash ecosystem, its main packages, and
    the available third-party packages crucial for structuring and building different
    parts of your apps. Next, you will learn how to create a basic Dash app and add
    different features to it. You'll then integrate controls such as dropdowns, checkboxes,
    sliders, date pickers, and more in the app, and then link them to charts and other
    outputs. Depending on the data you are visualizing, you will also add several
    types of charts, including scatter plots, line plots, bar charts, histograms,
    maps, and more, as well as exploring the options available for customizing them.

    and deploy an interactive dashboard, be able to handle complexity and code refactoring,
    and understand the process of improving your application.

- en: '[*Chapter 1*](B16780_01_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015), *Overview of
    the Dash Ecosystem*, will help you attain a good understanding of the Dash ecosystem,
    the main packages used, as well as the available third-party packages. By the
    end of this chapter, you will be able to differentiate between the different elements
    of an app and what each is responsible for, and you will have built a minimal
    app.'

    Structure of a Dash App*, demonstrates how to add some interactive functionality
    to the app we created earlier. We will go through the app callbacks and see how
    they allow your users to connect visual elements of your app, and how you can
    let users use some of those elements to control others by creating special callback
    functions.'

    Plotly''s Figure Objects*, provides an in-depth introduction to the figure object,
    its components, how it can be manipulated, and how it can be converted to different
    formats. Later on, we will use this understanding to build specific types of charts
    as needed in our application.'

    and Preparation - Paving the Way to Plotly Express*, introduces an overview of
    tidy data, as well as the high-level Plotly Express package, and shows how it
    uses the grammar of graphics to easily produce charts and map data to visual elements.'

    Comparing Values with Bar Charts and Dropdown Menus*, goes in some depth into
    the available options for graphs and explores further possibilities. Then, we
    will see how to allow users to select which values they want to compare using
    drop-down menus.'

    with Scatter Plots and Filtering Subsets with Sliders*, moves on to one of the
    most frequently used chart types: scatter plots. Like we did with bar charts,
    we will see many different ways to customize them. Scatter plots provide even
    more options that we will explore, such as mapping the size of the points to a
    certain variable, dealing with overplotting, and handling a large number of points.'

    that we see in many situations. There are many ways to plot data on maps, and
    we will explore two of the most frequently used types: scatter maps and choropleth
    maps.'

    to evaluate various clusters and finally, we will design an interactive app using
    Kmeans.'

    we will explore is using URLs either as inputs or outputs, interacting with different
    elements in the app.'
