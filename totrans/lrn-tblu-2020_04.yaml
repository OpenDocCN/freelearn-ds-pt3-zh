    interactivity in Tableau. In this chapter, we'll see how calculations can be used
    in a wide variety of ways. We'll see how calculations can be used to address common
    issues with data, extend data by adding new dimensions and measures, and provide
    additional flexibility in interactivity.

- en: At the same time, while calculations provide incredible power and flexibility,
    they introduce a level of complexity and sophistication. As you work through this
    chapter, try to understand the key concepts behind how calculations work in Tableau.
    As usual, follow along with the examples, but feel free to explore and experiment.
    The goal is not to merely have a list of calculations you can copy, but to gain
    knowledge of how calculations can be used to solve problems and add creative functionality
    to your visualizations and dashboards.

- en: A calculation is often referred to as a **Calculated Field** in Tableau because,
    in most cases, when you create a calculation, it will show up as either a new
    measure or dimension in the data pane. Calculations consist of code that's made
    up of functions, operations, and references to other fields, parameters, constants,
    groups, or sets. This code returns a value. Sometimes, this result is per row
    of data, and sometimes it is done at an aggregate level. We'll consider the difference
    between Tableau's major calculation types next.

    to dimensions if desired. In this case, though, you are not even able to redefine
    the new field as a dimension. The reason for this is that Tableau will treat every
    *aggregate calculation* as a measure, no matter what data type is returned. This
    is because an aggregate calculation depends on dimensions to define the level
    of detail at which the calculation is performed. So, an aggregate calculation

    This means that the calculation is performed once when the extract is created,
    and the results are then stored in the extract. This means that the data engine
    does not have to execute the calculation over and over. Instead, the value is
    simply read from the extract. Calculations that use any user functions, parameters,
    or `TODAY()` or `NOW()`, will not be materialized in an extract as the value necessarily
    changes according to the current user, parameter selection, and system time. Tableau's
    optimizer may also determine whether to materialize certain calculations that
    are more efficiently performed in memory rather than having to read the stored
    value.

    in Tableau. Row-level calculations are performed for every row of source data.
    These calculated fields can be used as dimensions or they can be aggregated as
    measures. Aggregate calculations are performed at the level of detail that's defined
    by the dimensions that are present in a view. They are especially helpful, and
    even necessary, when you must first aggregate components of the calculation before
    performing additional operations.
