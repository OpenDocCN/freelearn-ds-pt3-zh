    only focuses on the tactics to uplift a score. It may or may not drive the experience
    of using data, trusting data, and overall data management uplift. We need to approach
    data management with a renewed focus and a fresh set of eyes. We need to build
    foundational capabilities that scale without doubling the size of our teams as
    the amount of data doubles every few years. I challenge you to think beyond the
    maturity framework (although important), into the minds of your stakeholders.

- en: Once you have defined the steps in delivering each capability, based on specific
    deliverables, your next step is to align on the measurement of the value delivered.
    This is another step that requires a very tight partnership with your business
    stakeholders. Since you’ve defined the plan to get there (including what needs
    to be delivered, and for each capability), it’s time to align that they agree
    with this approach, you answer any questions that they might have, and you affirm
    that once these capabilities are delivered, they will be able to meet the overall
    business objective.

    contractual obligations, which was, essentially, to have their data well identified

- en: Assume your company has 500 customers. Ensuring you are compliant with all 500
    customer contractual obligations is critical to each of the customers’ contracts,
    given the agreement language is consistent. You can use the 500 to calculate an
    impact based on SLA violation in the contract (for example, let’s say the contract
    imposes a $10,000 fine for each violation). You can use the 500 customers * $10,000
    per violation to determine the value of the impact to be $5,000,000\. This is
    the value of the risk you are working to mitigate.

    with stakeholders about how to measure success, together. No one team can solve
    this independently; you must bring the discussion about value measurement into
    the early stages of the project, focus the stakeholders on the importance of alignment,
    and build a rigorous, transparent process into the normal flow of business. In
    my experience, many teams discuss having this capability, or may even claim to
    have something similar. In practice, very few teams do this consistently well
    across their entire company. Let’s normalize this process so that as a practice,
    we can demonstrate that there is an incredible **return on investment** (**ROI**)
    in data. In this chapter, we walked through the eight-step alignment methodology
    to drive outcomes with your stakeholders, common alignment challenges, and how
    to carry forward the measured outcomes to your stakeholder map for aggregated
