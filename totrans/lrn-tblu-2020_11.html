    <h1 id="_idParaDest-214" class="chapterTitle">Dynamic Dashboards</h1>
    <p class="normal">We've looked at dashboards previously, in <em class="italics">Chapter 8</em>, <em class="italics">Telling a Data Story with Dashboards</em>, and considered how to make them interactive using a variety of actions. Now we'll expand on that concept to consider how to create truly dynamic dashboards—dashboards where objects can be shown and hidden. This enables you to do all kinds of amazing things, such as allow the user to select which type of visualization to see or to dynamically hide or show controls that are relevant or desired.</p>
    <p class="normal">We'll consider the following types of dynamic interactivity:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="list">Show/Hide buttons</li>
      <li class="list">Sheet swapping</li>
      <li class="list">Automatically showing and hiding controls</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Let's start by considering how to show and hide content on dashboards using the Show/Hide buttons.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-215" class="title">Show/Hide buttons</h1>
    <p class="normal">The Show/Hide buttons<a id="_idIndexMarker989"/> allow you to show and hide layout containers (and everything in them!). You'll find a couple of examples in the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Chapter 11 Complete</code> workbook. The<code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-"> Chapter 11 Starter</code> workbook has the dashboards, but not the Show/Hide buttons or containers. The images used in the second example are also in the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Chapter 11</code> directory.</p>
    <p class="normal">To use the Show/Hide buttons, add a layout container to a dashboard as a <strong class="bold">floating object</strong> and then use the dropdown to select <strong class="screen-text">Add Show/Hide Button</strong>, as shown here in <em class="italics">Figure 11.1</em>:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_11_01.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.1: A dashboard with a single Map view and a floating layout container</p>
    <p class="normal">On this dashboard, we've <a id="_idIndexMarker990"/>added a vertical layout container floating over the map. When we select <strong class="screen-text">Add Show/Hide Button</strong>, Tableau adds a small button to the dashboard:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_11_02.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.2: The Show/Hide button for the layout container</p>
    <p class="normal">Each Show/Hide button can be applied to any single floating layout container on the dashboard.</p>
    <div class="packt_tip">
      <p>Use the <strong class="screen-text">Rename Dashboard Item…</strong> option on the layout container dropdown to make it easy to identify which layout container is the target of a Show/Hide button.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">You may edit the button's appearance<a id="_idIndexMarker991"/> and actions using the button's dropdown to select <strong class="screen-text">Edit Button...</strong>:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_11_03.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.3: Selecting Edit Button… reveals many options for altering the button's behavior and appearance</p>
    <p class="normal">In the resulting dialog box, you'll have options for selecting which layout container to show or hide, the style of the button (image or text), and which images or text to show when the container is shown or hidden.</p>
    <p class="normal">In this example, the Show/Hide button uses the default <strong class="screen-text">Image Button</strong> style (as seen in <em class="italics">Figure 11.3</em>) and the layout container has been filled with a couple of filters and the map's legend.</p>
    <div class="packt_tip">
      <p>You may include any dashboard objects in a container, including filters, legends, parameter and set controls, and even other views!</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">Additionally, the container has been given a border and a semi-transparent background so that the map is slightly visible beneath the container. This was accomplished by selecting the container <a id="_idIndexMarker992"/>and then using the <strong class="screen-text">Layout</strong> tab of the <strong class="screen-text">Dashboard</strong> pane, as shown here:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_11_04.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.4: Use the Layout pane to adjust options for any selected dashboard object</p>
    <p class="normal">The end result, demonstrated in the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Chapter 11</code> workbook, is a dashboard with a Show/Hide button that<a id="_idIndexMarker993"/> makes it clear to the user that additional options can be shown or hidden:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_11_05.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.5: Here you can see the layout container's hidden and shown states along with the changing image of the button</p>
    <div class="packt_tip">
      <p>Use <em class="italics">Alt </em>+ <em class="italics">Click</em> while in <strong class="bold">Design Mode</strong> to trigger the button action, or switch to <strong class="bold">Presentation Mode</strong> where a single click will trigger the button.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">Show/Hide buttons give you a lot of flexibility in your dashboard design, from optimizing space to simplifying the display, to removing filters and other clutter from printed output.</p>
    <p class="normal">Consider another example in the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Chapter 11 Complete</code> workbook that illustrates the possibility of showing and hiding instructions:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_11_06.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.6: Clicking the question mark button reveals instructions for how to use the dashboard</p>
    <p class="normal">In this case, the <a id="_idIndexMarker994"/>default button image has been replaced with a question mark icon. This is accomplished by editing the image as illustrated in <em class="italics">Figure 11.3</em> and changing the image (<code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">questionmark.png</code> is included in the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Chapter 11</code> directory.)</p>
    <p class="normal">When the user clicks the button, a floating container appears over the top of the entire dashboard. It includes text as well as an annotated image to instruct the user on how to use the dashboard. In this simple example, it might be overkill to supply instructions in this way, when a simple text label would suffice. </p>
    <p class="normal">However, as you build more complex dashboards or have detailed analyses that require explanation, this is a great way to give users additional instructions and detail that would otherwise clutter a dashboard.</p>
    <div class="packt_tip">
      <p>Consider also using Show/Hide buttons to allow user interactivity that you do not want to include in PDFs or printed pages of the dashboards. Filters and parameters are incredibly useful, but you don't always want them to show up in a polished output.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">Let's move on to<a id="_idIndexMarker995"/> consider another method of dynamically showing, hiding, and even swapping out content on a dashboard.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-216" class="title">Sheet swapping</h1>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Sheet swapping</strong>, sometimes <a id="_idIndexMarker996"/>also called <strong class="bold">sheet selection</strong>, is a technique in which <a id="_idIndexMarker997"/>views are dynamically shown and hidden on a dashboard, often with the appearance of swapping one view for another. The dynamic hiding and showing of views on a dashboard has an even broader application. When combined with floating objects and layout containers, this technique allows you to create rich and dynamic dashboards.</p>
    <p class="normal">Let's start with some fundamental principles of sheet swapping.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-217" class="title">Basic principles of sheet swapping</h2>
    <p class="normal">The basic principles <a id="_idIndexMarker998"/>are relatively simple. A view on a dashboard collapses when the following occur:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="list">At least one field is on rows or columns</li>
      <li class="list">It is in a horizontal or vertical <strong class="bold">layout container</strong></li>
      <li class="list">It does not have a fixed height or width and the layout container is not set to distribute items equally</li>
      <li class="list">A combination of filters or hiding prevents any marks from being rendered</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Additionally, titles and captions do not collapse with the view. However, these can be hidden so that the view collapses entirely.</p>
    <p class="normal">Next, we'll explore an example of how sheet swapping can be used in practice.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-218" class="title">Using sheet swapping to change views on a dashboard</h2>
    <p class="normal">Let's consider a simple <a id="_idIndexMarker999"/>example with a view showing <strong class="screen-text">Profit by Department and Category</strong> with a <strong class="screen-text">Department</strong> quick filter. The dashboard has been formatted (from the menu, select <strong class="screen-text">Format </strong>|<strong class="screen-text"> Dashboard</strong>) with gray shading to help us see the effect:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_11_07.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.7: A demonstration of hiding a sheet in a dashboard</p>
    <p class="normal">Observe how filtering out all departments results in the view collapsing. The title remains, but it could have been hidden.</p>
    <p class="normal">In order to swap two different sheets, we simply take advantage of the collapsing behavior along with the properties of layout containers. We'll start by creating two different views filtered through a parameter and a calculated field. The parameter will allow us<a id="_idIndexMarker1000"/> to determine which sheet is shown. Perform the following steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li class="list">Create an integer parameter named <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Show Sheet</code> with a list of <strong class="screen-text">String</strong> values set to <strong class="screen-text">Bar Chart</strong> and <strong class="screen-text">Map</strong>:<figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_11_08.png" alt=""/></figure>
        <p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.8: Creating a parameter to control which sheet is shown</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list">Since we want to filter based on the parameter selection and the parameters cannot be directly added to the <strong class="screen-text">Filters</strong> shelf, instead we'll create a calculated field named <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Show Sheet Filter</code> to return the selected value of the parameter. The code is simply <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">[Show Sheet]</code>, which is the parameter name, which returns the current value of the parameter.</li>
      <li class="list">Create a new sheet named <strong class="screen-text">Bar Chart</strong>, similar to the <strong class="screen-text">Profit by Department and Category</strong> view shown in <em class="italics">Figure 11.7</em>.</li>
      <li class="list">Show the parameter control (right-click the parameter in the data window and select <strong class="screen-text">Show Parameter Control</strong>). Make sure the <strong class="screen-text">Bar Chart</strong> option is selected.</li>
      <li class="list">Add the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Show Sheet Filter</code> field to the <strong class="screen-text">Filters</strong> shelf and check <strong class="screen-text">Bar Chart</strong> to keep that value.</li>
      <li class="list">Create another<a id="_idIndexMarker1001"/> sheet named <strong class="screen-text">Map</strong> that shows a filled map of states by profit:<figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_11_09.png" alt=""/></figure>
        <p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.9: The Map view</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list">Show the parameter on this view and change the selection to <strong class="screen-text">Map</strong>. Remember that parameter selections are universal to the worksheet. If you were to switch back to the <strong class="screen-text">Bar Chart</strong> view, it should no longer be showing any data because of the filter.</li>
      <li class="list">Add the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Show Sheet Filter</code> field to the <strong class="screen-text">Filters</strong> shelf and check <strong class="screen-text">Map</strong> as the value to keep.</li>
      <li class="list">Create a new dashboard named <strong class="screen-text">Sheet Swap</strong>.</li>
      <li class="list">Add a <strong class="screen-text">Horizontal</strong> layout container to the dashboard from the objects in the left window:<figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_11_10.png" alt=""/></figure>
        <p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.10: Insert a Horizontal layout container</p>
        <div class="note">
          <p class="Information-Box--PACKT-">A <strong class="screen-text">Vertical</strong> layout container would work just as well in this case. The key is that a layout container will allow each view inside to expand to fill the container when the view is set to fit the entire view, or fit the width (for horizontal containers), or fit the height (for vertical containers). When one view collapses, the visible view will expand to fill the rest of the container.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li class="list">Add each <a id="_idIndexMarker1002"/>sheet to the layout container in the dashboard. The parameter control should be added automatically since it was visible in each view.</li>
      <li class="list">Using the drop-down menu on the <strong class="screen-text">Bar Chart</strong> view, ensure the view is set to fill the container (<strong class="screen-text">Fit</strong> | <strong class="screen-text">Entire View</strong>). You won't have to set the fill for the map because map visualizations automatically fill the container.</li>
      <li class="list" value="13">Hide the title for each view (right-click the title and select <strong class="screen-text">Hide Title</strong>).</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="normal">You now have a dashboard where changing the parameter results in one view or the other being shown. When <strong class="screen-text">Map</strong> is selected, the filter results in no data for the bar chart, so it collapses and the map fills the container:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_11_11.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.11: Map is visible while Bar Chart is collapsed</p>
    <p class="normal">Alternately, when <strong class="screen-text">Bar Chart</strong> is selected, the map collapses due to the filter and the bar chart fills the<a id="_idIndexMarker1003"/> container:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_11_12.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.12: Bar Chart is visible while Map is collapsed</p>
    <div class="packt_tip">
      <p>The key to collapsing a view is to have a filter or set of filters that ensures no rows of data are shown. You do not have to use a parameter to control the filtering. You could use a regular filter or action filter to accomplish the same effect. This opens up all kinds of possibilities for dynamic behavior in dashboards.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">Sheet swapping can lead to amazing effects on your dashboard. From allowing the user to select a type of visualization, to swapping out a view that works well for a small set of data, to a view that summarizes at a higher level for a larger set, consider using sheet swapping for a dynamic experience.</p>
    <div class="packt_tip">
      <p>In some cases, you might consider an alternative to sheet swapping, such as using a navigation<a id="_idIndexMarker1004"/> button to navigate between different versions of the dashboard rather than trying to swap content in the same dashboard.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">Sheet swapping allows you to swap views in a dashboard. What if the change in views makes certain legends, filters, or parameters no longer applicable and you wish to hide them? Let's consider some possibilities.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-219" class="title">Automatically showing and hiding other controls</h1>
    <p class="normal">Views will collapse when<a id="_idIndexMarker1005"/> all data is filtered out. However, other controls, such as quick filters, parameters, images, legends, and textboxes, will not collapse. You could use a Show/Hide button as we previously discussed, but often you'll want to show or hide these controls automatically as filters change, without forcing the user to take additional action.</p>
    <p class="normal">Consider the simple example in the previous section. The color legend, which was automatically added to the dashboard by Tableau, applies to the map. But when the bar chart is shown, the legend is no longer applicable.</p>
    <p class="normal">Fortunately, we can extend the technique we used in the previous section to expand a view to push items we want to show out from under a floating object and then collapse the view to allow the items we want to hide to return to a position under the floating object.</p>
    <p class="normal">Let's extend the earlier sheet swapping example to see how to show and hide the color legend:</p>
    <ol>
      <li class="list" value="1">Create a new sheet named <strong class="screen-text">Show/Hide Legend</strong>. This view is only used to show and hide the color legend.</li>
      <li class="list">Create an ad hoc calculation by double-clicking on <strong class="screen-text">Rows</strong> and type <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">MIN(1)</code>. We must have a field on rows or columns for the view to collapse, so we'll use this field to give us a single axis for <strong class="screen-text">Rows</strong> and a single axis for <strong class="screen-text">Columns</strong> without any other headers.</li>
      <li class="list">Duplicate the ad hoc calculation on <strong class="screen-text">Columns</strong>. You should now have a simple scatterplot with one mark.</li>
      <li class="list">As this is a helper sheet and not anything we want the user to see, we don't want it to show any marks or lines. Format the view using <strong class="screen-text">Format </strong>|<strong class="screen-text"> Lines</strong> to remove <strong class="bold">Grid Lines</strong> from <strong class="screen-text">Rows</strong> and <strong class="screen-text">Columns</strong>, along with <strong class="bold">Axis Rulers</strong>. Additionally, hide the axes (right-click each axis or field and uncheck <strong class="screen-text">Show Headers</strong>). Also, set the color to full transparency to hide the mark.</li>
      <li class="list">We will want this view to show when the map option is selected, so show the parameter control and ensure it is set to <strong class="screen-text">Map</strong>, and then add the <strong class="screen-text">Show Sheet Filter</strong> to filters <a id="_idIndexMarker1006"/>and check <strong class="screen-text">Map</strong>:<figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_11_13.png" alt=""/></figure>
        <p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.13: The Show/Hide Legend sheet with the Show Sheet Filter applied</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list">On the <strong class="screen-text">Sheet Swap</strong> dashboard, add the <strong class="screen-text">Show/Hide Legend</strong> sheet to the layout container between the <strong class="screen-text">Show Sheet</strong> parameter dropdown and the color legend. Hide the title for the <strong class="screen-text">Show/Hide Legend</strong> sheet.</li>
      <li class="list">Ensure that <strong class="screen-text">Map</strong> is selected. The color legend should be pushed all the way to the bottom.</li>
      <li class="list">Add a layout container as a floating object. In terms of size and position, it should completely cover the area where the color legend used to be. It should cover the title of the <strong class="screen-text">Show/Hide Legend</strong> sheet but not the parameter dropdown.
    <div class="packt_tip">
      <p>Objects and sheets can be added as floating objects by holding <em class="italics">Shift</em> while dragging, setting the <strong class="screen-text">New Objects</strong> option to <strong class="screen-text">Floating</strong>, or by using the drop-down menu on the object. You may also change the default behavior for new objects from tiled to floating in the <strong class="screen-text">Dashboard</strong> pane.</p>
    </div>
	</li>
    </ol>
    <ol>
      <li class="list" value="9">The layout container is transparent by default, but we want it to hide what is underneath. Format it using the drop-down menu and add white shading so it is indistinguishable from the background.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="normal">At this point, you have a dynamic dashboard in which the legend is shown when the map is shown and <a id="_idIndexMarker1007"/>it is applicable, and hidden when the bar chart is visible. When <strong class="screen-text">Map</strong> is selected, the <strong class="screen-text">Show/Hide Legend</strong> sheet is shown and pushes the legend to the bottom of the <strong class="screen-text">Layout Container</strong>:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_11_14.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.14: The Show/Hide Legend pushes the legend down past the floating object</p>
    <p class="normal">When <strong class="screen-text">Bar Chart</strong> is selected, the <strong class="screen-text">Show/Hide Legend</strong> sheet collapses and the legend, which is no longer applicable to the view, falls under/hides behind the <strong class="screen-text">Floating Layout Container</strong>:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_11_15.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.15: The Show/Hide Legend collapses, causing the legend to move under the floating object</p>
    <p class="normal">There is no limit to how many variations of this technique you can use on a dashboard. You can have as<a id="_idIndexMarker1008"/> many layers as you'd like. You can even use combinations of these techniques to push views and objects on and off the dashboard. The possibilities for creating a richly interactive user experience are incredible.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-220" class="title">Summary</h1>
    <p class="normal">Creating truly dynamic dashboards give you incredible flexibility in your dashboard design. Show/Hide buttons give the end user the option to show or hide content on the dashboard. Sheet-swapping techniques allow you to swap out which views are shown and also automatically show or hide controls or other content. </p>
    <p class="normal">The techniques covered in this chapter will enable you to accomplish all sorts of amazing interactivity, from hiding and showing controls, instructions, and explanations of business rules and analysis to allowing users to determine visualization types and swap views in and out.</p>
    <p class="normal">Next, we'll turn our attention to exploring a certain kind of data using some advanced techniques: geospatial data!</p>
