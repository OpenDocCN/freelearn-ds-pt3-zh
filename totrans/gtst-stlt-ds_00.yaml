- en: Data scientists and machine learning engineers throughout the 2010s have primarily
    produced static analyses. We create documents to inform decisions, filled with
    plots and metrics about our findings, or about the models we create. Creating
    complete web applications that allow users to interact with analyses is cumbersome,
    to say the least! Enter Streamlit, a Python library for creating web applications
    built with data folks in mind at every step.

- en: Streamlit shortens the development time for the creation of data-focused web
    applications, allowing data scientists to create web app prototypes in Python
    in hours instead of days.

- en: This book takes a hands-on approach to help you learn the tips and tricks that
    will have you up and running with Streamlit in no time. You'll start with the
    fundamentals of Streamlit by creating a basic app and gradually build on this
    foundation by producing high-quality graphics with data visualization and testing
    machine learning models. As you advance through the chapters, you'll walk through
    practical examples of both personal and work-related data-focused web applications,
    and will learn about more complicated topics such as using Streamlit Components,
    beautifying your apps, and the quick deployment of your new apps.

- en: This book assumes that you are at least a Python novice, which means you are
    comfortable with basic Python syntax and have taken tutorials or classes before
    in Python. It is also written for users interested in data science, which includes
    topics such as statistics and machine learning, but does not require a data science
    background. If you know how to make lists and define variables and have written
    a `for` loop before, you have enough Python knowledge to get started!
