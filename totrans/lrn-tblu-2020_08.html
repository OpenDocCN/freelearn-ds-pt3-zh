    <h1 id="_idParaDest-158" class="chapterTitle">Telling a Data Story with Dashboards</h1>
    <p class="normal">In data discovery and analysis, you will likely create numerous data visualizations. Each of these visualizations gives you a snapshot of a story within the data. Each insight into the data answers a question or two. At times, the discovery and analysis phase is enough for you to make a key decision and the cycle is complete. In other cases, you will need to bring the snapshots together to communicate a complete and compelling story to your intended audience.</p>
    <p class="normal">Tableau allows you to bring together related data visualizations into a single dashboard. This dashboard could be a static view of various aspects of the data or a fully interactive environment, allowing users to dynamically filter, drill down, and interact with the data visualizations.</p>
    <p class="normal">In this chapter, we'll take a look at most of these concepts within the context of several in-depth examples, where we'll walk through the dashboard design process, step by step. As before, don't worry about memorizing lists of instructions. Instead, focus on understanding why and how the components and aspects of dashboards work.</p>
    <p class="normal">This chapter will cover the following topics:</p>

    <p class="normal">For the examples in this chapter, we'll return to the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Superstore Sales</code> sample data we used in the previous chapters. Go ahead and create a new workbook with a connection to that dataset, and we'll begin by introducing the key concepts of dashboards.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-159" class="title">Introduction to dashboards</h1>
    <p class="normal">Before diving<a id="_idIndexMarker690"/> into some practical examples, let's take some time to understand what a dashboard is and why you might create one.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-160" class="title">Dashboard definition</h2>
    <p class="normal">From a Tableau <a id="_idIndexMarker691"/>perspective, a <strong class="bold">dashboard</strong> is an arrangement of individual visualizations, along with other components, such as legends, filters, parameters, text, containers, images, extensions, buttons, and web objects, that are arranged on a single canvas. Ideally, the visualizations and components should work together to tell a complete and compelling data story. Dashboards are usually (but not always) interactive.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-161" class="title">Dashboard objectives</h2>
    <p class="normal">The primary objective<a id="_idIndexMarker692"/> of a dashboard is to communicate data to a certain audience with an intended result. Often, we'll talk about <em class="italics">telling the data story</em>. That is, there is a narrative (or multiple narratives) contained within the data that can be communicated to others.</p>
    <p class="normal">While you can tell a data story with a single visualization or even a series of complex dashboards, a single Tableau dashboard is the most common way to communicate a single story. Each dashboard seeks to tell a story by giving a clear picture of certain information. Before framing the story, you should understand what story the data tells. How you tell the story will depend on numerous factors, such as your audience, the way the audience will access the dashboard, and what response you want to elicit from your audience.</p>
    <p class="normal">Stephen Few, one of the leading experts in the field of data visualization, defines a dashboard as <em class="italics">a visual display of the most important information that's needed to achieve one or more objectives, consolidated and arranged on a single screen so the information can be monitored at a glance</em>.</p>
    <div class="note">
      <p class="Information-Box--PACKT-">This definition is <a id="_idIndexMarker693"/>drawn from Few's paper <em class="italics">Dashboard Confusion</em>, which can be read here: <a href="https://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/ie/dashboard_confusion.pdf"><span class="url">https://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/ie/dashboard_confusion.pdf</span></a>.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">This definition is helpful to consider because it places some key boundaries around the data story and the way we will seek to tell it in Tableau. In general, your data story should follow these guidelines:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="list">The data story should focus on the most important information. Anything that does not communicate or support the main story should be excluded. You may wish to include that information in other dashboards.</li>
      <li class="list">The data story that you tell must meet your key objectives. Your objectives may range from giving information to providing an interface for further exploration, to prompting your audience to act or make key decisions. Anything that doesn't support your objectives should be reserved for other dashboards.</li>
      <li class="list">The data story should be easily accessible, and the main idea should be clear. Depending on your audience, you may wish to explicitly state your conclusions from the data, or you may want to guide your audience so that they can draw their own.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">When you set out to build<a id="_idIndexMarker694"/> a dashboard, you'll want to carefully consider your objectives. Your discovery and analysis should have uncovered various insights into the data and its story. Now, it's your responsibility to package that discovery and analysis into a meaningful communication of the story to your particular audience in a way that meets your <a id="_idIndexMarker695"/>objectives and their needs. The way you handle this task is called your <strong class="bold">approach</strong>.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-162" class="title">Dashboard approaches</h2>
    <p class="normal">There are numerous<a id="_idIndexMarker696"/> possible approaches to building dashboards based on your objectives. The following is by no means a comprehensive list:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Guided analysis</strong>: You've done the analysis, made the discoveries, and thus have a deep understanding of the implications of the data story. Often, it can be helpful to design a dashboard that guides your audience through a similar process of making the discoveries for themselves, so the need to act is clear. For example, you may have discovered wasteful spending in the marketing department, but the team may not be ready to accept your results unless they can see how the data led you to that conclusion.</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Exploratory</strong>: Many times, you do not know what story the data will tell when the data is refreshed in the next hour, next week, or next year. What may not be a significant aspect of the story today might be a major decision point in the future. In these cases, your goal is to provide your audience with an analytical tool that gives them the ability to explore and interact with various aspects of the data on their own. For example, today, customer satisfaction is high across all regions. However, your dashboard needs to give your organization the ability to continually track satisfaction over time, dynamically filter by product and price, and observe any correlations with factors such as quality and delivery time.</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Scorecard/Status snapshot</strong>: There<a id="_idIndexMarker697"/> may be a wide agreement on <strong class="bold">Key Performance Indicators</strong> (<strong class="bold">KPIs</strong>) or metrics that indicate good versus poor performance. You don't need to guide the audience through discovery or force them to explore. They just need a high-level summary and the ability to drill down into details to quickly find and fix problems and reward success. For example, you may have a dashboard that simply shows how many support tickets are still unresolved. The manager can pull up the dashboard on a mobile device and immediately take action if necessary.</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Narrative</strong>: This type of dashboard emphasizes a story. There may be aspects of exploration, guided analysis, or performance indication, but primarily you are telling a single story from the data. For example, you may desire to tell the story of the spread of an invasive species of insect, including where it started, how quickly it spread, the results, and the efforts to contain it. Your dashboard should tell the story, using data, in a visual way.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">We'll look at several in-depth<a id="_idIndexMarker698"/> examples to better understand a few of these different approaches and incorporate many of the skills we've covered in previous chapters. First, we'll introduce some key aspects of designing dashboards in Tableau.</p>
    <div class="packt_tip">
      <p>Your dashboard may have a hybrid approach. For example, you might have an exploratory dashboard that prominently displays some KPIs. However, be careful to not overload a dashboard. Trying to meet more than one or two objectives with any single dashboard will likely result in an overwhelming mess.</p>
    </div>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-163" class="title">Designing dashboards in Tableau</h1>
    <p class="normal">No matter your<a id="_idIndexMarker699"/> objective or approach, the practical task<a id="_idIndexMarker700"/> of designing a dashboard in Tableau will look similar each time. In this section, we will go through some fundamental concepts.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-164" class="title">Objects</h2>
    <p class="normal">Dashboards are made <a id="_idIndexMarker701"/>up of objects that are arranged on a canvas. You'll see a list of objects that can be added to a dashboard in the left-hand pane of a dashboard:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject" style=""><img src="../Images/B16021_08_01.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 8.1: Objects available to add to a dashboard</p>
    <p class="normal">The pane includes these objects:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="list"><strong class="screen-text">Horizontal</strong>: A layout container within which other objects will be arranged in a single row (horizontally).</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="screen-text">Vertical</strong>: A layout container within which other objects will be arranged in a single column (vertically).</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="screen-text">Text</strong>: An object that allows you to include richly formatted text in your dashboard.</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="screen-text">Image</strong>: An image (for example, <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">.gif</code>, <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">.png</code>, or <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">.jpeg</code>) that can be positioned and sized on your dashboard. Optionally, you may set a URL for navigation when a user clicks the image.</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="screen-text">Web Page</strong>: An object that allows you to embed web content in the dashboard. You may set the URL at design time. We'll also consider how to use actions to dynamically change the URL.</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="screen-text">Blank</strong>: A blank object that can be used as a placeholder or to provide spacing options.</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="screen-text">Navigation</strong>: A navigation button allows you to define user navigation to other sheets and dashboards in the workbook.</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="screen-text">Export</strong><strong class="bold">: </strong>An export object allows you to create a link or button that gives the user an easy option to export the dashboard as an image, PDF, or PowerPoint.</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="screen-text">Extension</strong>: One of a growing number of tools developed by Tableau and third parties (or maybe even you!) that leverages the extensions API to provide extended functionality to dashboards. This could allow you to accomplish things such as gathering extensive usage data, dynamically updating parameters, incorporating visualizations from other platforms (such as D3), and much more.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">In addition to the objects that you can add through the sidebar, there are other objects that may be applicable to a given dashboard:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Filters</strong>: These will <a id="_idIndexMarker702"/>appear as controls for the end user so that they can select values to filter</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Parameters</strong>: Similar to filters, these will show up as controls for the end user to select a parameter option</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Page controls</strong>: These are controls that give the end user options for paging through the data and may be used to animate visualizations and dashboards</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Legends</strong>: These include color, size, and shape legends to help the end user understand various visualizations</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Highlighters</strong>: These allow the user to highlight various dimension values within views</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Dashboard title</strong>: A special text object that displays the name of the dashboard sheet by default</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="_idParaDest-165" class="title">Tiled versus floating</h3>
    <p class="normal">An object is either tiled <a id="_idIndexMarker703"/>or floating. If it is a tiled object, it will snap into the dashboard or layout container where you drop it. If it is a floating object, it will float over the dashboard in layers. You can change the order of the layers for a floating object.</p>
    <p class="normal">You'll notice the <strong class="screen-text">Tiled</strong> or <strong class="screen-text">Floating</strong> buttons directly beneath the <strong class="screen-text">Objects</strong> pallet in the preceding image. These buttons define the default setting for objects that you place on the dashboards, but you can change whether any given object is tiled or floating.</p>
    <div class="packt_tip">
      <p>Hold down the <kbd class="Key--PACKT-">Shift</kbd> key as you drag an object to quickly change it from tiled to floating, or from floating to tiled.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">As you become experienced in designing dashboards, you'll likely develop a preference for designing using a predominately tiled approach or a predominately floating approach. (You can mix tiled and floating objects on any dashboard). Many designers find one design method or the other fits their style. Here are some considerations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Precision</strong>: Floating objects can be sized and positioned to exact pixel-perfection, while tiled objects will depend greatly upon their containers for position and size.</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Speed</strong>: Many designers find a tiled layout much faster to create as they don't have to worry about precision or layering.</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Dynamic resizing</strong>: Floating objects work well on a fixed-size dashboard, but a dashboard that dynamically resizes based on window size will shift floating objects, often into<a id="_idIndexMarker704"/> undesirable locations. Tiled objects move and resize more reliably (but not always perfectly!).</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Flexibility</strong>: Certain design techniques can be accomplished with one approach or the other. For example, transparent visualizations can be layered on top of background images using a floating technique. However, sheet swapping (which we'll consider in <em class="italics">Chapter 11</em>, <em class="italics">Dynamic Dashboards</em>) is often accomplished with a tiled approach.</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Maintenance</strong>: Changes to the layout of a floating dashboard might be harder and more tedious than doing so for tiled layouts.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Experiment with various design techniques and feel free to develop your own style!</p>
    <h3 id="_idParaDest-166" class="title">Manipulating objects on the dashboard</h3>
    <p class="normal">You may wish to <a id="_idIndexMarker705"/>manipulate an object once it is part of a dashboard. Every object has certain controls that become visible when you select it:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_08_02.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 8.2: Various controls become accessible once you select a dashboard object</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="list"><strong class="screen-text">Grip</strong>: Click and drag the grip to move the object.</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="screen-text">Remove from Dashboard</strong>: Click this to remove the object from the dashboard.</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="screen-text">Go to Sheet</strong>: To edit a single visualization on a dashboard, use this button to navigate to the<a id="_idIndexMarker706"/> individual sheet.</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="screen-text">Use as Filter</strong>: Clicking here will enable the view to be used as a filter. Selecting a mark in the view will now filter other views on the dashboard. We'll look at the specifics of filter actions later in this chapter and how you can have finer control over how a view can be used as a filter.</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="screen-text">More Options</strong>: This drop-down arrow reveals a host of options for the object, including control display options for parameters and filters; showing or hiding titles or captions on views; adding legends, parameters, and filters to the dashboard; formatting, layout, and size options; and more.</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="screen-text">Object Sizing Border</strong>: Hovering over the border will cause your cursor to change to a sizing cursor. You can drag the border to adjust the size of the object.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="packt_tip">
      <p>You may notice different sizing behavior based on what type of container an object is inside and whether the object is tiled or floating.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">In the first sections of this chapter, we have introduced the theoretical fundamentals of dashboards and <a id="_idIndexMarker707"/>some key elements of their design. Now, let's apply these concepts with a practical example.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-167" class="title">A dashboard to understand profitability</h1>
    <p class="normal">Having covered <a id="_idIndexMarker708"/>some conceptual topics as well as practical matters related to dashboard design, we'll dive into an example.</p>
    <p class="normal">Let's say you've been tasked with helping management find which items are the least profitable. Management feels that most of the least profitable items should be eliminated from their inventory. However, since you've done your analysis, you've discovered that certain items, while not profitable overall, have made a profit at times in various locations. Your primary objective is to give management the ability to quickly see an analysis of the least profitable items to identify whether an item has always been unprofitable, answering the question, "Is the least profitable item always unprofitable?" This example will combine aspects of a guided analytics dashboard and an exploratory tool.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-168" class="title">Building the views</h2>
    <p class="normal">Use the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Superstore Sales</code> dataset <a id="_idIndexMarker709"/>and follow these steps to build the individual views that will form the basis of the dashboard:</p>
    <ol>
      <li class="list">Create a bar chart showing profit by category. Sort the categories in descending order by the sum of profit.</li>
      <li class="list">Add the <strong class="screen-text">Department</strong> field to <strong class="screen-text">Filters</strong> and show a filter. To accomplish this, use the drop-down menu of the <strong class="screen-text">Department</strong> field in the data pane and select <strong class="screen-text">Show Filter</strong>.</li>
      <li class="list">Name the sheet <strong class="screen-text">Overall Profit by Category</strong>:<figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_08_03.png" alt=""/></figure>
        <p class="packt_figref">Figure 8.3: A bar chart showing the sum of profit by category with Department as a filter</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list">Create <a id="_idIndexMarker710"/>another similar view showing profit by item. Sort the items in descending order by the sum of profit.</li>
      <li class="list">You'll notice that there are too many items to see at once. For your objectives on this dashboard, you can limit the items to only the top 10 least profitable ones. Add the <strong class="screen-text">Item</strong><em class="italics"> </em>field to the <strong class="screen-text">Filters</strong> shelf, select the <strong class="screen-text">Top</strong> tab, and adjust the settings to filter by field. Specify <strong class="screen-text">Bottom 10</strong> by <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Sum(Profit)</code>:<figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_08_04.png" alt=""/></figure>
        <p class="packt_figref">Figure 8.4: Use the Top tab to set the number of items to display</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list">Rename the sheet <strong class="screen-text">Top 10 Least Profitable Items</strong>:<figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_08_05.png" alt=""/></figure>
        <p class="packt_figref">Figure 8.5: The resulting bar chart shows the top 10 least profitable items</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list">Create anothe<a id="_idIndexMarker711"/>r sheet that displays a filled map of profit by state. You can accomplish this rather quickly by double-clicking the <strong class="screen-text">State</strong> field in the data window and then dropping <strong class="screen-text">Profit</strong> on the <strong class="screen-text">Color</strong> shelf. (Note: if your regional settings are not US, you may need to use the <strong class="screen-text">Edit Locations</strong> option to set the country to the United States.)</li>
      <li class="list">Rename the sheet to <strong class="screen-text">Profit by State</strong>:<figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_08_06.png" alt=""/></figure>
        <p class="packt_figref">Figure 8.6: A filled map showing profit by state</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list">Create one<a id="_idIndexMarker712"/> final sheet to show when profits were made or lost. Ensure that the <strong class="screen-text">Order Date</strong> field has been added as the <strong class="screen-text">Quarter</strong> date value and that it is continuous (green).</li>
      <li class="list">Add a linear trend line. To do this, switch to the <strong class="screen-text">Analytics</strong><em class="italics"> </em>tab of the left sidebar and drag <strong class="screen-text">Trend Line</strong> from <strong class="screen-text">Model</strong><em class="italics"> </em>to the view. Alternatively, right-click a blank area of the canvas of the view and select <strong class="screen-text">Trend Lines</strong> | <strong class="screen-text">Show Trend Lines</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
    <ol>
      <li class="list" value="11">Rename the sheet to <strong class="screen-text">Profit Trend</strong>:
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_08_07.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 8.7: A line chart showing the trend of profit by quarter</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p class="normal">Now that you've<a id="_idIndexMarker713"/> created the views that will make up the dashboard, let's start to put the dashboard together!</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-169" class="title">Creating the dashboard framework</h2>
    <p class="normal">At this point, you <a id="_idIndexMarker714"/>have all of the necessary views to achieve the objectives for your dashboard. Now, all that remains is to arrange them and enable the interactivity that's required to effectively tell the story:</p>
    <ol>
      <li class="list" value="1">Create a new dashboard by clicking the <strong class="screen-text">New Dashboard</strong><em class="italics"> </em>tab to the right of all existing worksheet tabs or by selecting <strong class="screen-text">Dashboard</strong> | <strong class="screen-text">New Dashboard</strong><em class="italics"> </em>from the menu.</li>
      <li class="list">Rename the new dashboard <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Is Least Profitable Always Unprofitable?</code>.</li>
      <li class="list">At the bottom of the left sidebar, check <strong class="screen-text">Show dashboard title</strong>.</li>
    
      <li class="list" value="4">Add the views to the dashboard by dragging them from the <strong class="screen-text">Dashboard </strong>pane of the left sidebar and dropping them into the dashboard canvas. Arrange them as follows:
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_08_08.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 8.8: All views are placed on the dashboard</p>
    <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet-End--PACKT-">After<a id="_idIndexMarker715"/> adding views to the dashboard, you'll want to take some time to reposition and resize various elements and views.</p>
</li>
    </ol>
    <ol>
      <li class="list" value="5">Use the drop-down menu on the <strong class="screen-text">Department</strong> filter and change the control to <strong class="screen-text">Single Value</strong> (drop-down).</li>
    
      <li class="list" value="6">You'll notice that changing the value of the filter only changes the <strong class="screen-text">Overall Profit by Category</strong> view. You can adjust which views the filter applies to by using the drop-down menu. Using the drop-down menu, select <strong class="screen-text">Apply to Worksheets</strong> | <strong class="screen-text">All Using This Data Source</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="normal">Options for applying filters may be set using the drop-down on the filter control or on the field on the filters shelf in the view. The options include the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">All Using Related Data Sources</strong>: The filter will be applied to all data sources where the field used for filtering is related between data sources. Relationships may be edited from <strong class="screen-text">Data</strong> | <strong class="screen-text">Edit Relationships</strong> on the main menu.</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">All Using This Data Source</strong>: The filter will be applied to any view using the data source as the primary data source.</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Selected Worksheets...</strong>: The filter will be applied to the worksheets you select.</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Only This Worksheet</strong>: The filter will be applied only to the current worksheet.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Now, let's get <a id="_idIndexMarker716"/>back to creating our dashboard framework.</p>
    <ol>
      <li class="list" value="7">From the left sidebar, drag and drop a text object above <strong class="screen-text">Overall Profit by Category</strong> and enter the following instructions:<ol>
          <li class="Numbered-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="screen-text">Select a Department from the drop-down</strong></li>
          <li class="Numbered-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="screen-text">Select a category below</strong></li>
          <li class="Numbered-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="screen-text">Select an Item below</strong></li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li class="list">Using the grip, move the <strong class="screen-text">Department</strong> filter immediately above the <strong class="screen-text">Top 10 Least Profitable Items</strong> view.</li>
      <li class="list">Size the text object to align the <strong class="screen-text">Top 10</strong> view with the overall view.</li>
      <li class="list">Move the <strong class="screen-text">Profit</strong> color legend below the <strong class="screen-text">Profit by State</strong> view.</li>
      <li class="list">Use the drop-down menu of <strong class="screen-text">Overall Profit by Category</strong> to <strong class="screen-text">Fit</strong> | <strong class="screen-text">Entire View</strong>. This will ensure that all of the categories are visible without the need for a scrollbar.</li>
   
      <li class="list" value="12">Additionally, fit <strong class="screen-text">Top 10 Least Profitable Items</strong> to <strong class="screen-text">Entire View</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="normal">At this point, your dashboard should look similar to the following:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_08_09.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 8.9: The polished dashboard with rearranged and resized objects</p>
    <p class="normal">We now have<a id="_idIndexMarker717"/> a dashboard with all the views we want to include. As you've seen, it's easy to add views and objects and rearrange them as desired. Let's continue by examining how to drive a story with actions.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-170" class="title">Implementing actions to guide the story</h2>
    <p class="normal">You now have <a id="_idIndexMarker718"/>a framework that will support the telling of the data story. Your audience will be able to locate the least profitable items within the context of a selected category. Then, the selection of an item will answer the question of whether it has always been unprofitable in every location. To enable this flow and meet your objectives, you'll often need to enable interactivity. In this case, we'll use actions. We'll conclude this example with some specific steps and then unpack the intricacies of actions later in the chapter:</p>
    <ol>
      <li class="list" value="1">Click the <strong class="screen-text">Use as Filter</strong> button on the <strong class="screen-text">Overall Profit by Category</strong> view. This will cause the view to be used as an interactive filter for the entire dashboard. That is, when the user selects a bar, all other views will be filtered based on the selection:<figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_08_10.png" alt=""/></figure>
        <p class="packt_figref">Figure 8.10: The Use As Filter control on the Profit by Category view</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list">From the <a id="_idIndexMarker719"/>main menu, select <strong class="screen-text">Dashboard</strong> | <strong class="screen-text">Actions</strong>. You'll see a list containing one action named <strong class="screen-text">Filter 1 (generated)</strong>. This is the action that was created when you selected <strong class="screen-text">Use as Filter</strong> previously:<figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_08_11.png" alt=""/></figure>
        <p class="packt_figref">Figure 8.11: Filter 1 (generated) was created when the filter control was clicked</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list">Click the <strong class="screen-text">Add Action &gt;</strong> button and select <strong class="screen-text">Filter</strong>. The resulting dialog gives you options for selecting the source and target, as well as additional options for the action.</li>
    </ol>
    <ol>
      <li class="list" value="4">Here, we want<a id="_idIndexMarker720"/> an action that filters everything except the <strong class="screen-text">Overall Profit by Category </strong>view when the user selects an item. In the <strong class="screen-text">Add Filter Action</strong> dialog, set <strong class="screen-text">Source Sheets</strong> to <strong class="screen-text">Top 10 Least Profitable Items</strong>, and <strong class="screen-text">Target Sheets</strong><em class="italics"> </em>to <strong class="screen-text">Profit by State</strong> and <strong class="screen-text">Profit Trend</strong>. Make sure that the action is set to run on <strong class="screen-text">Select</strong>. Name the filter <strong class="screen-text">Filter by Item</strong>, and then click <strong class="screen-text">OK</strong> on this dialog. Do the same on the <strong class="screen-text">Actions</strong> dialog:
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_08_12.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 8.12: Setting options for the Filter by Item action</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p class="normal">You now have three filters (two are actions) that drive the dashboard:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="list">Selecting a<a id="_idIndexMarker721"/> department from the drop-down will filter the entire dashboard (and actually all views in the workbook as you set it to filter every view using the data source)</li>
      <li class="list">Selecting a category (clicking a bar or header) will filter the entire dashboard to that selection</li>
      <li class="list">Selecting an item (clicking a bar or header) will filter the <strong class="screen-text">Profit by State</strong> and <strong class="screen-text">Profit Trend</strong> dashboards</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="packt_tip">
      <p>You can clear a selection in a view by clicking a blank area or by clicking the selected mark one more time. For example, if you click the bar for <strong class="screen-text">Bookcases</strong><em class="italics"> </em>to select it (and thus filter the rest of the dashboard), you may click the bar one more time to deselect it.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">Experiment<a id="_idIndexMarker722"/> with the filters and actions to see how your dashboard functions.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-171" class="title">Context filtering</h2>
    <p class="normal">You may have<a id="_idIndexMarker723"/> noticed that when you use the drop-down filter to select a single department or select a single category, you have fewer than 10 items in the Top 10 view. For example, selecting <strong class="screen-text">Furniture</strong> from the <strong class="screen-text">Department</strong> filter and clicking on the bar for <strong class="screen-text">Tables</strong><em class="italics"> </em>results in only three items being shown. This is because the <strong class="screen-text">Top Item</strong> filter is evaluated at the same time as the action filter. There are only three items with the category of <strong class="screen-text">Tables</strong> that are also in the <strong class="screen-text">Top 10</strong>.</p>
    <p class="normal">What if you want to see the top 10 items within the category of <strong class="screen-text">Tables</strong>? You can accomplish this using context filters.</p>
    <div class="note">
      <p class="Information-Box--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">Context filters</strong> are a <a id="_idIndexMarker724"/>special kind of filter in Tableau that are applied before other filters. Other filters are then applied within the context of the context filters. Conceptually, context filters result in a subset of data upon which other filters and calculations operate. In addition to <strong class="bold">Top Filters</strong>, <strong class="bold">Computed Sets</strong> and <strong class="bold">Fixed Level of Detail</strong> calculations are also computed within the context defined by context filters.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">In this case, navigate to the <strong class="screen-text">Top 10</strong> sheet and add the <strong class="screen-text">Department</strong> filter and the newly added action <strong class="screen-text">(Category)</strong> filter to the context using the drop-down menu of the fields on the <strong class="screen-text">Filters</strong> shelf. Once added to the context, those fields will be gray on the filters shelf. Now, you will see the top 10 items within the context of the selected department and category:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_08_13.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 8.13: The 10 least profitable items will be within the context of the Action (Category) and Department filters</p>
    <p class="normal">Notice that adding<a id="_idIndexMarker725"/> filters to the context causes the fields to be color-coded gray on the <strong class="screen-text">Filters</strong> shelf.</p>
    <div class="packt_tip">
      <p>If you edit the action on the dashboard, the filter might be automatically updated and you may have to re-add it to the context.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">Go ahead and step through the actions by selecting a couple of different categories and a couple of different items. Observe how the final dashboard meets your objectives by telling a story:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_08_14.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 8.14: The final dashboard with filters triggered by selection</p>
    <p class="normal">The user has selected <strong class="screen-text">Technology</strong> from the <strong class="screen-text">Department</strong> drop-down, <strong class="screen-text">Telephones and Communications</strong> from the <strong class="screen-text">Category</strong> list, and then <strong class="screen-text">Item 10631</strong>, which is the least profitable item <a id="_idIndexMarker726"/>within the category. This reveals the states where the item was sold (color-coded by profit) and a time series of profit for the item.</p>
    <p class="normal">Should management remove item 10631 from the inventory? Not without first considering that the item only lost profit in one instance and that the trend is positive toward greater profitability. Granted, the original loss was a large loss, but this was also a long time ago and every subsequent sale of the item resulted in a gain. The results of your findings may lead to further analysis to determine what factors play a part in the profit and loss for the item and better decision making by management.</p>
    <div class="packt_tip">
      <p>When you look at the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Chapter 08 Completed</code> workbook, you'll only see a tab at the bottom for the dashboard. The individual views have been hidden. Hiding tabs for sheets that are used in dashboards or stories is a great way to keep your workbook clean and guide your audience away from looking at sheets that are meant to be seen in the context of a dashboard or story. To hide a sheet, right-click the tab and select <strong class="screen-text">Hide Sheet</strong>. To unhide a sheet, navigate to the dashboard or story using the sheet, right-click the sheet in the left-hand side pane and uncheck <strong class="screen-text">Hide Sheet</strong>. Additionally, you can hide or unhide all sheets that are used in a dashboard by right-clicking the dashboard tab and selecting the appropriate option. Sheets that are used in tooltips may be hidden or unhidden in the same way.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">You now have a<a id="_idIndexMarker727"/> fully interactive dashboard! You built the views, added them to the dashboard, and then created some meaningful calculations. Along the way, you learned about <strong class="bold">top filters</strong> and <strong class="bold">context filters</strong>. Now, let's consider how you might design dashboards for different displays and devices.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-172" class="title">Designing for different displays and devices</h1>
    <p class="normal">When designing a<a id="_idIndexMarker728"/> dashboard, some of the first questions you'll often ask yourself are: <em class="italics">How will my audience view this dashboard? What kind of device will they use?</em> With the wide adoption of mobile devices, this latter question becomes very important because what looks great on a large flat-screen monitor doesn't always look great on a tablet or phone.</p>
    <p class="normal">The top of the <strong class="screen-text">Dashboard</strong> tab on the left sidebar reveals a button to preview the dashboard on various devices, as well as a drop-down for <strong class="screen-text">Size</strong> options:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_08_15.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 8.15: The Device Preview option allows you to design and preview your dashboard for other devices</p>
    <p class="normal">Clicking the <strong class="screen-text">Device Preview</strong> button not only allows you to see how your dashboard will look with <a id="_idIndexMarker729"/>various device types (and even specific models) but also allows you to add a layout for each device type, which you can customize:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_08_16.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 8.16: Customizable options for devices</p>
    <p class="normal">You can not only see how your dashboard will appear on various devices and models but also how it will look based on the orientation of the device and whether the Tableau Mobile app is used (if available for the selected device).</p>
    <p class="normal">Clicking the <strong class="screen-text">Add Layout</strong> button (that is, the <strong class="screen-text">Add Tablet Layout</strong> button in the preceding screenshot) will add a layout under the <strong class="screen-text">Dashboard</strong> tab on the left sidebar:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_08_17.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 8.17: Each layout can be configured with various options</p>
    <p class="normal">Each layout can have its own size and fit options, and the layout options allow you to switch from <strong class="screen-text">Default</strong> to <strong class="screen-text">Custom</strong>. This gives you the ability to rearrange the dashboard for any given<a id="_idIndexMarker730"/> layout. You may even remove views and objects for a certain layout. For example, you might simplify a dashboard to one or two views for a phone while leaving three or four in place for a desktop display.</p>
    <p class="normal">The <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Chapter 08 Completed</code> workbook contains an example of the profit analysis dashboard and has a couple of layout options. For example, here is that dashboard formatted for display on a phone in which the dashboard will fit according to the width of the phone and allow scrolling up and down:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_08_18.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 8.18: The phone layout of the dashboard</p>
    <p class="normal">As you can see, the <a id="_idIndexMarker731"/>arrangement of the dashboard for the phone means that <strong class="screen-text">Profit by State</strong> and <strong class="screen-text">Profit Trend</strong> do not appear within the preview boundaries for a phone device. However, they are only a finger swipe away.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-173" class="title">Interactivity with actions</h1>
    <p class="normal">In Tableau, an <strong class="bold">action</strong> is<a id="_idIndexMarker732"/> a user-initiated event that triggers a response from Tableau. You've seen a few examples of actions being used in dashboards already. We'll now consider some details of how actions work in Tableau.</p>
    <p class="normal">Tableau supports<a id="_idIndexMarker733"/> six kinds of actions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Filter actions</strong>: The user's action causes one or more filters to be applied to one or more views.</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Highlight actions</strong>: The user's action causes specific marks and headers to be highlighted in one or more views.</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">URL actions</strong>: The user's action causes a specific URL to be opened (either in a browser, a new tab, or in an embedded web object).</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Go to Sheet</strong>: The user's action causes navigation to a selected sheet or dashboard.</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Parameter actions</strong>: The user's action changes the value of a parameter. This allows the user to visually interact with parameters in new and exciting ways!</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Set actions</strong>: The user's action defines a set. Sets may be used in calculations, filters, and on shelves to define visual attributes of marks. This opens a lot of possibilities to allow complex and creative interactions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Certain actions are automatically generated by Tableau based on shortcuts. For example, you can select <strong class="screen-text">Use as Filter</strong><em class="italics"> </em>from the drop-down menu of a view on a dashboard, which results in an automatically generated filter action. Enabling highlighting using the button on a discrete color legend or from the toolbar will automatically generate a highlight action:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_08_19.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 8.19: Options for enabling highlighting</p>
    <p class="normal">You can also create or edit dashboard actions by selecting <strong class="screen-text">Dashboard</strong> | <strong class="screen-text">Actions</strong> from the menu. Let's <a id="_idIndexMarker734"/>consider the details of each type of action.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-174" class="title">Filter actions</h2>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Filter actions</strong> are<a id="_idIndexMarker735"/> defined by one or more source sheets<a id="_idIndexMarker736"/> that pass one or more dimensional values as filters to target sheets upon an action. Remember that every mark on a sheet is defined by a unique intersection of dimensional values. When an action occurs involving one or more of those marks, the dimensional values that comprise the mark(s) can be passed as filters to one or more target sheets.</p>
    <p class="normal">When you create or edit a filter action, you will see options like these:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_08_20.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 8.20: Options for filter actions</p>
    <p class="normal">This screen <a id="_idIndexMarker737"/>allows<a id="_idIndexMarker738"/> you to do the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="list">Name the filter.</li>
      <li class="list">Choose <strong class="screen-text">Source</strong> and <strong class="screen-text">Target</strong> sheets. The <strong class="screen-text">Source</strong> sheet is where the user will initiate the action (hover, selection, menu) and the <strong class="screen-text">Target</strong> sheet is where the response will be applied (filtering in this example, but also highlighting).</li>
      <li class="list">Set the action that triggers the filter and whether the selection of multiple marks or only a single mark initiates the action.</li>
      <li class="list">Choose what happens when the selection is cleared.</li>
      <li class="list">Specify which dimensions are used to pass filter values to the <strong class="screen-text">Target</strong> sheet(s).</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="packt_tip">
      <p>Try to name your actions using names that help you differentiate between multiple actions in the dashboard. Additionally, if your action is set to run on <strong class="screen-text">Menu</strong>, then the name you use will be shown as a link in the tooltip. Use the arrow to the right of the name to insert special field placeholders. These will be dynamically updated with the values of the fields for a mark when the user sees the menu option in a tooltip.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">You may select as<a id="_idIndexMarker739"/> many source and target sheets as you<a id="_idIndexMarker740"/> desire. However, if you specify particular <strong class="screen-text">Target filters</strong> in the bottom section, the fields you select must be present in the source sheet (for example, on <strong class="screen-text">Rows</strong>, <strong class="screen-text">Columns</strong>, and <strong class="screen-text">Detail</strong>). You will receive a warning if a field is not available for one or more <strong class="screen-text">Source</strong> sheets and the action will not be triggered for those sheets. Most of the time, your source and target will be the same dashboard. Optionally, you can specify a different target sheet or dashboard, which will cause the action to navigate to the target in addition to filtering.</p>
    <div class="note">
      <p class="Information-Box--PACKT-">When filter actions are defined at the worksheet level (when viewing a worksheet, select <strong class="screen-text">Worksheet</strong> | <strong class="screen-text">Actions</strong> from the menu), a menu item for that action will appear as menu items for every mark on every sheet that uses the same data source. You can use this to quickly create navigation between worksheets and from dashboards to individual worksheets.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">Filter actions can be set to occur on any one of three possible actions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Hover</strong>: The user moves the mouse cursor over a mark (or taps a mark on a mobile device).</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Select</strong>: The user clicks or taps a mark, and a rectangle/radial/lasso selects multiple marks by clicking and dragging a rectangle around them and clicks a header (in which case all marks for that header are selected). A user may deselect by clicking/tapping the already selected mark, clicking/tapping an empty space in the view, or by clicking/tapping the already selected header.</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Menu</strong>: The user selects the menu option for the action on the tooltip.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Consider the following example of a filter action that's triggered when a bar is selected in the source:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_08_21.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 8.21: Clicking the bar for Tables passes Category as a filter to the Target sheet</p>
    <p class="normal">Each bar mark<a id="_idIndexMarker741"/> in the source is defined by the <strong class="screen-text">Category</strong> dimension. When<a id="_idIndexMarker742"/> the bar for <strong class="screen-text">Tables</strong> is selected, a single filter is set on the target.</p>
    <p class="normal">If the mark is defined by more than one dimension (for example, <strong class="screen-text">Category</strong> and <strong class="screen-text">Region</strong>), then the target sheet will still have a single filter with the combination of dimension values that had been selected. </p>
    <p class="normal">In this example, the filter contains <strong class="screen-text">Office Machines</strong> and <strong class="screen-text">West</strong>, matching the dimensions that define the selected square:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_08_22.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 8.22: Clicking the square for the intersection of Office Machines and West passes both dimensional values as a single action filter to the target</p>
    <p class="normal">By default, all dimensions present in the source view are used in a filter action. Optionally, you can specify which fields should be used. You can use the <strong class="screen-text">Selected Fields </strong>option in the <strong class="screen-text">Edit Filter Actions</strong> dialog to accomplish the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="list">Filter based on fewer dimensions. For example, if you only selected the <strong class="screen-text">Region</strong> field, then <a id="_idIndexMarker743"/>selecting the preceding square would <a id="_idIndexMarker744"/>only pass the West region as a filter to the target.</li>
      <li class="list">Filter a target view using a different data source. The <strong class="screen-text">Selected Fields</strong> option allows you to map the source field to a target field (even if the target field has a different name, though the values must still match). For example, if the target used a data source where <strong class="screen-text">East</strong> was a possible value for a field named <strong class="screen-text">Area</strong>, you could map <strong class="screen-text">Region</strong> from the source to <strong class="screen-text">Area</strong> in the target.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Filter actions are very useful for narrowing focus, drilling into detail, and seeing different aspects of a selected dimension. You'll find yourself using them often. Let's consider another type of action: highlight actions.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-175" class="title">Highlight actions</h2>
    <p class="normal">This type of action<a id="_idIndexMarker745"/> does not filter<a id="_idIndexMarker746"/> target sheets. Instead, <strong class="bold">highlight actions</strong> cause marks that are defined, at least in part, by the selected dimensional value(s) to be highlighted in the target sheets. The options for highlight actions are very similar to filter actions, with the same configuration options for source and target sheets, and which events are able to trigger the action.</p>
    <p class="normal">Consider a dashboard with three views and a highlight action based on the <strong class="screen-text">Region</strong> field. When the action is triggered for the <strong class="screen-text">East</strong> region, all marks defined by <strong class="screen-text">East</strong> are highlighted. The dimension(s) that are used for the highlight must be present in all views where you <a id="_idIndexMarker747"/>want the highlighting to be applied. Both the map<a id="_idIndexMarker748"/> and scatter plot have <strong class="screen-text">Region</strong> on the <em class="italics">Detail</em> part of the <em class="italics">Marks</em> card:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_08_23.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 8.23: Clicking the bar for East has highlighted all other marks associated with that dimensional value</p>
    <div class="note">
      <p class="Information-Box--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">Highlighters</strong> (also called <strong class="bold">data highlighters</strong>) are shown as user controls (similar to filters and<a id="_idIndexMarker749"/> parameters) that cause highlighting based on user interaction. They can be applied to one or more views and will highlight the marks of the views. They do not create an action. To add highlighters, select any discrete (blue) field in the view and use the drop-down menu to click <strong class="screen-text">Show Highlighter</strong>. Alternatively, you<a id="_idIndexMarker750"/> can use the menu and select <strong class="screen-text">Analysis</strong> | <strong class="screen-text">Highlighters</strong>. On a dashboard, you can add a highlighter by using a view's <a id="_idIndexMarker751"/>drop-down menu and selecting <strong class="screen-text">Highlighters</strong>.</p>
    </div>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-176" class="title">URL actions</h2>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="bold">URL actions</strong> allow you to <a id="_idIndexMarker752"/>dynamically generate a URL based on an action and open it <a id="_idIndexMarker753"/>within a web object in the dashboard or in a new browser window or tab. URL actions can be triggered by the same hover, menu, and select events as other actions. The name of the URL action differentiates it and will appear as the link when used as a menu.</p>
    <p class="normal">The URL includes any hardcoded values you enter as well as placeholders that are accessible via the arrow to the right of the URL text box. These placeholders include fields and parameters. The values will be dynamically inserted into the URL string when the action is triggered based on the values for the fields that make up the selected mark(s) and current values for parameters.</p>
    <p class="normal">If you have included a web object in the dashboard, the URL action will automatically use that as the target. Otherwise, the action opens a new browser window (using your default browser, when the dashboard is viewed in desktop or reader) or a new tab (when the dashboard is viewed in a web browser).</p>
    <div class="packt_tip">
      <p>Some web pages have different behaviors when viewed in iframes. The browser object does not use iframes in Tableau Desktop or Tableau Reader but does when the dashboard is published to Tableau Server, Tableau Online, or Tableau Public. You will want to test URL actions based on how your dashboards will be viewed by your audience.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">You may specify a target for the URL action when you create or edit the URL action:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_08_24.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 8.24: Options for a URL action</p>
    <p class="normal">Options include <strong class="screen-text">New Browser Tab</strong>, <strong class="screen-text">Web Page Object</strong> (you may select which object if you have more<a id="_idIndexMarker754"/> than one on the dashboard), and <strong class="screen-text">Browser Tab if No Web Page Object Exists</strong>. If you have more than one web page object on the dashboard, you <a id="_idIndexMarker755"/>may wish to give them meaningful names to make selection easier. </p>
    <p class="normal">To accomplish this, switch to the <strong class="screen-text">Layout</strong> tab on the left-hand side pane and expand <strong class="screen-text">Item hierarchy</strong> until you locate the objects you wish to rename. Right-click the object and select <strong class="screen-text">Rename Dashboard Item…</strong>:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_08_25.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 8.25: Dashboard objects can be renamed using the item hierarchy and the right-click context menu</p>
    <p class="normal">After you have renamed the object, you will be able to more readily identify which one is the target of the URL action.</p>
    <p class="normal">Next, we'll consider<a id="_idIndexMarker756"/> another type of action that accomplishes a specific <a id="_idIndexMarker757"/>result: navigation.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-177" class="title">Go to Sheet actions</h2>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Go to Sheet actions</strong> (also called <a id="_idIndexMarker758"/>navigation actions) allow<a id="_idIndexMarker759"/> you to specify navigation to another dashboard or sheet in the workbook based on user interaction with one or more views. For example, clicking a bar in a bar chart might navigate to another dashboard. These are similar to filter actions that define another sheet as a target, but Go to Sheet actions do not set any filters.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-178" class="title">Parameter actions</h2>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Parameter actions</strong> allow<a id="_idIndexMarker760"/> you<a id="_idIndexMarker761"/> to set the value of a parameter based on a user action. When you create a parameter action, you'll set options using a screen like this:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_08_26.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 8.26: Options for a parameter action</p>
    <p class="normal">As with other <a id="_idIndexMarker762"/>actions, you<a id="_idIndexMarker763"/> may select the sheets and user interactions (<strong class="screen-text">Hover</strong>, <strong class="screen-text">Select</strong>, <strong class="screen-text">Menu</strong>) that trigger the action. Additionally, you will set the target parameter and specify which field will set the value. You may use any field in the sheet and may also specify an aggregation for the field.</p>
    <p class="normal">We saw in <em class="italics">Chapter 4</em>, <em class="italics">Starting an Adventure with Calculations and Parameters</em>, how parameters<a id="_idIndexMarker764"/> can be used to accomplish all kinds of results. You can use them in <a id="_idIndexMarker765"/>calculations, filters, and <strong class="screen-text">Top N</strong> sets, and you can use them to define reference lines and alter the visual aspects of any view. This opens a world of possibilities for driving an interactive experience using views and triggers.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-179" class="title">Set actions</h2>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Set actions</strong> allow<a id="_idIndexMarker766"/> you to populate a set with one or more <a id="_idIndexMarker767"/>values for one or more dimensions. This is very powerful because sets can be used on any shelf to encode any visual element, can be leveraged in calculations, and can be used as filters. They can be used in all of these ways—and in different ways—in different views. This gives you incredible flexibility in what can be accomplished with set actions. We'll first take a moment to define sets more clearly and then look at an example of a set action.</p>
    <h3 id="_idParaDest-180" class="title">Sets</h3>
    <p class="normal">A <strong class="bold">set</strong> in Tableau defines a collection of records from the data source. At a row-level, each record is either in or <a id="_idIndexMarker768"/>out of the set. There are two types of sets:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="list">Dynamic sets (sometimes called computed or calculated sets)</li>
      <li class="list">Fixed sets</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">A <strong class="bold">dynamic set</strong> is computed <a id="_idIndexMarker769"/>for a single dimension based on a conditional <a id="_idIndexMarker770"/>calculation you define. As the data changes, the results of the condition may change and records may switch between in and out of the set. </p>
    <p class="normal">For example, if you were to use the drop-down menu on <strong class="screen-text">Customer Name</strong> in the data pane and select <strong class="screen-text">Create</strong> | <strong class="screen-text">Set</strong>, then you could stipulate a condition that defines which records belong to the set:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_08_27.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 8.27: A dynamic set based on a condition</p>
    <p class="normal">In this example, we've created a dynamic set named <strong class="screen-text">Customers who purchased more than $100</strong> with a<a id="_idIndexMarker771"/> condition<a id="_idIndexMarker772"/> that's set by the sum of sales being greater than <strong class="screen-text">100</strong>. You'll notice that there are also options for computing <strong class="screen-text">By formula</strong> or <strong class="screen-text">Top</strong> N. All of these conditions are going to be at an aggregate level (across the entire dataset or across the context if context filters are used) and then each record is evaluated as to whether it is in or out of the set. In this case, the total sales for each customer will be computed across the dataset and then each record will be counted in or out of the set based on whether the customer for that record has total sales greater than $100.</p>
    <p class="normal">A <strong class="bold">fixed set</strong> is a list <a id="_idIndexMarker773"/>of <a id="_idIndexMarker774"/>values for one or more dimensions. If the values for a single record match the list defined by the set, then the record is in the set, and out otherwise. For example, you might create another set based on the <strong class="screen-text">Customer Name </strong>field, this<a id="_idIndexMarker775"/> time <a id="_idIndexMarker776"/>with the <strong class="screen-text">General</strong> tab:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_08_28.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 8.28: A static set based on the selection of members</p>
    <p class="normal">Here, you can select individual values that will define what is in or out of the set. Note the option to exclude rather than include values. In this case, we've created a set named <strong class="screen-text">Customers with first name of Aaron</strong>. Any records that have a <strong class="screen-text">Customer Name</strong> value that matches one of the <strong class="screen-text">6</strong> values we selected will be in the set. All others will be out. Because this<a id="_idIndexMarker777"/> is a fixed set, the values are not ever calculated or recalculated. If <a id="_idIndexMarker778"/>records with a customer named Aaron Burr show up in the dataset next week, they will still be out of the set.</p>
    <p class="normal">As we'll see in the following example, set actions operate on fixed sets.</p>
    <h3 id="_idParaDest-181" class="title">A set action example</h3>
    <p class="normal">You'll find an example<a id="_idIndexMarker779"/> of a set action in the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Chapter 08 Complete.twbx</code> workbook in the dashboard named <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Sales by Region and Category (set actions)</code>, which looks like this:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_08_29.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 8.29: The set action allows brushing: highlighting the portion of the bars that belong to the selection</p>
    <p class="normal">The dashboard consists of two views: a map and a bar chart. Selecting a region on the map triggers a set<a id="_idIndexMarker780"/> action that updates the bar chart. A filter action would filter the bar chart, causing the length of each bar to only show the value for the selected region. Here, however, the set action is used to show the portion of the overall bar that belongs to that region while still retaining the full length of the bar for all regions.</p>
    <p class="normal">To replicate this interactivity, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li class="list" value="1">Use the drop-down menu on the <strong class="screen-text">Region</strong> field under <strong class="screen-text">Dimensions</strong> on the data pane to select <strong class="screen-text">Create</strong> | <strong class="screen-text">Set</strong>. Name the set <strong class="screen-text">Region Set</strong>.</li>
    
      <li class="list" value="2">In the resulting <strong class="screen-text">Create Set</strong> dialog, under the <strong class="screen-text">General</strong> tab, check one or more values. This creates a fixed set. In this example, it does not matter which, if any, values you select because you'll configure the set action to update the values momentarily.</li>
    
      <li class="list" value="3">Create a bar chart of <strong class="screen-text">Sales by Category</strong>.</li>
    
      <li class="list" value="4">Drag <strong class="screen-text">Region Set</strong> from <strong class="screen-text">Sets</strong> on the<a id="_idIndexMarker781"/> data pane and drop it on <strong class="screen-text">Color</strong>:
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_08_30.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 8.30: Drag and drop the set on Color to show the difference between In and Out of the set</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p class="normal">You may use a set on shelves, just as you would any other field. Notice how the set gives two values, that is, <strong class="screen-text">In</strong> and <strong class="screen-text">Out</strong>, which define two colors. You may wish to adjust the colors to emphasize <strong class="screen-text">In</strong>.</p>
    <div class="packt_tip">
      <p>You may use sets in calculated fields as well. For example, the code <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">[Region Set]</code> gives a Boolean true/false result for each record, indicating whether it is in the set.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">Conclude the set action example by creating a region map, the dashboard, and implementing the set action:</p>
    <ol>
      <li class="list" value="5">Use the drop-down menu on <strong class="screen-text">Region</strong> to select <strong class="screen-text">Geographic Role</strong> | <strong class="screen-text">Create from...</strong> | <strong class="screen-text">State</strong>. This tells Tableau to treat <strong class="screen-text">Region</strong> as a geographic field based on its relationship with the geographic field <strong class="screen-text">State</strong>.</li>
      <li class="list">In a new, blank view, double-click the <strong class="screen-text">Region</strong> field to create the map view. Now that <strong class="screen-text">Region</strong> is<a id="_idIndexMarker782"/> recognized as a geographic field, Tableau will generate latitude, longitude, and the geometries that are necessary to render the shapes.</li>
      <li class="list">Add both the map and bar chart views to a single dashboard. You may position them however you'd like.</li>
    </ol>
    <ol>
      <li class="list" value="8">Add a set action by selecting <strong class="screen-text">Dashboard</strong> | <strong class="screen-text">Actions</strong> from the menu and then <strong class="screen-text">Add Action</strong> | <strong class="screen-text">Change Set Values...</strong> in the resulting dialog. The resulting dialog has many similar features to other action types:
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_08_31.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 8.31: Options for the set action</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p class="normal">You'll notice <a id="_idIndexMarker783"/>options to give the action values for <strong class="screen-text">Name</strong>; <strong class="screen-text">Run action on:</strong> <strong class="screen-text">Hover</strong>, <strong class="screen-text">Select</strong>, or <strong class="screen-text">Menu</strong>; and options for <strong class="screen-text">Clearing the selection</strong>. Just like other action types, you may also specify <strong class="screen-text">Source </strong>sheets that trigger the action. <strong class="screen-text">Target Set</strong> allows you to specify which data source and which fixed set in that data source will have values updated based on the action. In this case, we want to update <strong class="screen-text">Region Set</strong> when a selection is made on the <strong class="screen-text">Sales by Region (set actions)</strong> view. We'll elect to remove all values from the set when the selection is cleared.</p>
    <p class="normal">Once you have created the preceding action, your dashboard should function very similarly to the example that was shown at the beginning of this section. Selecting a region on the map highlights the portion of the bars that correspond to that region. This technique is<a id="_idIndexMarker784"/> known <a id="_idIndexMarker785"/>as <strong class="bold">brushing</strong>, or <strong class="bold">proportional brushing</strong>.</p>
    <p class="normal">This technique is only one of hundreds of the possible applications of set actions. Since sets can be used on any shelf and in calculations, updating the values via set actions opens up almos<a id="_idIndexMarker786"/>t limitless possibilities for user interaction and analytics.</p>
    <p class="normal">Having looked at the various kinds of actions, let's move on to consider another example of a different kind of dashboard.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-182" class="title">A regional scorecard dashboard</h1>
    <p class="normal">Now, we'll consider another example dashboard that demonstrates slightly different objectives. Let's say<a id="_idIndexMarker787"/> everyone in the organization has agreed upon a KPI of profit<strong class="bold"> </strong>ratio. Furthermore, there is consensus that the cut-off point between an acceptable and poor profit ratio is 15%, but management would like to have the option of adjusting the value dynamically to see whether other targets might be better.</p>
    <p class="normal">Consider the following dashboard:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_08_32.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 8.32: A simple profit KPI dashboard</p>
    <p class="normal">This dashboard <a id="_idIndexMarker788"/>allows your audience to very quickly evaluate the performance of each region over the last six months. Executive management could very quickly pull this dashboard up on their mobile devices and take appropriate action as needed.</p>
    <p class="normal">The dashboard provides interactivity with the KPI target parameter. Additional drill-down capability into other dashboards or views could be provided if desired. If this view were published on Tableau Server, it is not unreasonable to think that regional managers might subscribe to the view and receive a scheduled email containing an up-to-date image of this dashboard.</p>
    <p class="normal">Let's consider how to create a similar dashboard:</p>
    <ol>
      <li class="list" value="1">Create a float type parameter named <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Profit Ratio KPI Target</code> set to an initial <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">.15</code>, formatted as a percentage.</li>
      <li class="list">Create a calculation named <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Profit Ratio</code> with the code <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">SUM([Profit]) / SUM([Sales])</code>. This is an aggregate calculation that will divide the profit total by the sum of sales at the level of detail defined in the view.</li>
      <li class="list">Create a second <a id="_idIndexMarker789"/>calculation named <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">KPI - Profit Ratio</code> with the following code:
        <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code"><span class="hljs-keyword">IF</span> [Profit <span class="hljs-keyword">Ratio</span>] &gt;= [Profit <span class="hljs-keyword">Ratio</span> KPI Target] 
THEN <span class="hljs-string">"Acceptable"</span> 
<span class="hljs-keyword">ELSE</span> <span class="hljs-string">"Poor"</span> 
<span class="hljs-keyword">END</span> 
</code></pre>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet-End--PACKT-">This code will compare the profit ratio to the parameterized cut-off value. Anything equal to or above the cut-off point will get the value of <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Acceptable</code>, and everything below will get the value of <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Poor</code>.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list">Create a new sheet named <strong class="screen-text">Region Scorecard</strong>. The view consists of <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Region</code> on <strong class="screen-text">Rows</strong>, <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Order Date</code> as a discrete date part on <strong class="screen-text">Columns</strong>, and the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">KPI - Profit Ratio</code> field on both shape and color. You'll observe that the shapes have been edited to use checkmarks and Xs, and that the color palette is using colorblind-safe blue and orange.</li>
      <li class="list">Add column grand totals using the <strong class="screen-text">Analytics</strong><em class="italics"> </em>pane and format the grand totals with a custom label of <strong class="screen-text">Overall</strong>, with bold font and light gray shading.</li>
      <li class="list">Add <strong class="screen-text">Order Date</strong> as a filter and set it to the top 6 by field (<strong class="screen-text">Order Date</strong> as <strong class="screen-text">Min</strong>). This will dynamically filter the view to the last six months:<figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_08_33.png" alt=""/></figure>
        <p class="packt_figref">Figure 8.33: This view defines the Region scorecard showing Acceptable versus Poor results per region per month</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list">Create another sheet named <strong class="screen-text">Profit Ratio by Region</strong>.</li>
      <li class="list">If you skipped the set actions example, use the drop-down menu on <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Region</code> to select <strong class="screen-text">Geographic Role</strong> | <strong class="screen-text">Create from...</strong> | <strong class="screen-text">State</strong>. This tells Tableau to treat <strong class="screen-text">Region</strong> as a geographic field based on its relationship with the geographic field <strong class="screen-text">State</strong>.</li>
      <li class="list">Double-click the <strong class="screen-text">Region</strong> field in the data pane. Tableau will automatically generate a geographic visualization based on <strong class="screen-text">Region</strong>. We'll examine the creation of custom <a id="_idIndexMarker790"/>geographies in more detail in <em class="italics">Chapter 12</em>, <em class="italics">Exploring Mapping and Advanced Geospatial Features</em>.</li>
      <li class="list">Place <strong class="screen-text">Profit Ratio</strong> on <strong class="screen-text">Color</strong> and <strong class="screen-text">Label</strong>. You will also want to format <strong class="screen-text">Profit Ratio</strong> as a percentage. You may do so by formatting the field in this view specifically, or by setting the default number format for the field in the data pane (the latter is probably preferred as you will almost always want it to display as a percentage).</li>
      <li class="list">Additionally, add <strong class="screen-text">Region</strong> to <strong class="screen-text">Label</strong>. Rearrange the fields in the marks card to reorder the label or click the <strong class="screen-text">Label</strong> shelf to edit the label text directly.</li>
      <li class="list">Apply the same filter to this view as you did to the <strong class="screen-text">Region Scorecard</strong> view. You may wish to navigate to the <strong class="screen-text">Region Scorecard</strong> sheet and use the drop-down on <strong class="screen-text">Order Date</strong> on the <strong class="screen-text">Filters</strong> shelf to apply the existing filter to multiple sheets:
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_08_34.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 8.34: The filled map shows profit by region</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p class="normal">Once both views have<a id="_idIndexMarker791"/> been created, you can arrange the views as a dashboard. The example in the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Chapter 08 Complete</code><strong class="screen-text"> </strong>workbook has a phone layout applied to it as seen here:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_08_35.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 8.35: A phone layout for the KPI dashboard</p>
    <p class="normal">Experiment with<a id="_idIndexMarker792"/> various layouts and positioning of the elements.</p>
    <div class="note">
      <p class="Information-Box--PACKT-">By default, all objects that are added to the dashboard are tiled. <strong class="bold">Tiled</strong> objects snap in place and appear beneath <strong class="bold">floating</strong> objects. Any object can be added to the dashboard as a floating object by switching the toggle under <strong class="screen-text">New Objects</strong> in the left window, or by holding <kbd class="Key--PACKT-">Shift</kbd> while dragging the objects to the dashboard.</p>
      <p class="Information-Box--PACKT-">Existing objects can be switched between floating and tiled by holding <kbd class="Key--PACKT-">Shift</kbd> while moving the object or using the drop-down caret menu. The drop-down caret menu also gives you options for adjusting the floating order of objects. Additionally, floating objects can be resized and positioned with pixel precision by selecting the floating object and using the positioning and sizing controls in the lower left.</p>
      <p class="Information-Box--PACKT-">You can mix tiled and floating elements, but many dashboard authors prefer to build dashboards that are composed entirely of one or the other. This ensures consistency between different layouts and sizes of screens (especially if the dashboard is set to an <strong class="screen-text">Automatic</strong> or <strong class="screen-text">Range</strong> sizing option).</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">This example illustrates a dashboard used for quick lookup and rapid decision making. What if we want <a id="_idIndexMarker793"/>to tell a more complex story and show progression of detail and maybe even present the data story in a specific order? Let's consider how to leverage a feature of Tableau designed specifically for that purpose.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-183" class="title">Stories</h1>
    <p class="normal">The <strong class="bold">stories</strong> feature allows you to tell a story using interactive snapshots of dashboards and views. The <a id="_idIndexMarker794"/>snapshots become points in a story. This allows you to <a id="_idIndexMarker795"/>construct a guided narrative or even an entire presentation.</p>
    <p class="normal">Let's consider an example in which story points might be useful. The executive managers are pleased with the <strong class="screen-text">Regional Scorecard</strong> dashboard you developed previously. Now, they want you to make a presentation to the board and highlight some specific issues for the South region. With minimal effort, you can take your simple scorecard, add a few additional views, and tell an entire story:</p>
    <ol>
      <li class="list" value="1">First, we'll build a couple of additional views. Create a simple geographic view named <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">ProfitRatio KPI by State</code>.

      <li class="list">Add <strong class="screen-text">Profit Ratio</strong> to the <strong class="screen-text">Detail</strong> part of the <strong class="screen-text">Marks</strong> card so that it is available for later use:<figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_08_36.png" alt=""/></figure>

Use <strong class="screen-text">Order Date</strong> as a continuous<a id="_idIndexMarker796"/> date value on <strong class="screen-text">Columns</strong> and <strong class="screen-text">Profit Ratio</strong> on <strong class="screen-text">Rows</strong>.</li>
      <li class="list">Set the mark<a id="_idIndexMarker797"/> type to bars.

      <li class="list">Add <strong class="screen-text">KPI – Profit Ratio</strong> to <strong class="screen-text">Color</strong>. You may also wish to click the <strong class="screen-text">Color</strong> shelf and add a border.</li>

    <p class="normal">When you are ready to share your discovery and analysis, you will likely use dashboards to relate the story to your audience. The way in which you tell the story will depend on your objectives, as well as your audience and the mode of delivery. Using a combination of views, objects, parameters, filters, and legends, you can create an incredible framework for telling a data story. Tableau allows you to specifically design layouts for different devices to ensure that your audience has the best experience possible. By introducing actions and interactivity, you can invite your audience to participate in the story. Story points will allow you to bring together many snapshots of dashboards and views to craft and present entire narratives.</p>
    <p class="normal">In the next chapter, we'll turn our attention to some deeper analysis involving trends, distributions, forecasting, and clustering.</p>
