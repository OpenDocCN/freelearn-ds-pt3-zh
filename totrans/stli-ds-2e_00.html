    <h1 class="mainHeading" id="_idParaDest-5">Preface</h1>
    <p class="normal">Data scientists and machine learning engineers throughout the 2010s have primarily produced static analyses. We create documents to inform decisions, filled with plots and metrics about our findings or about the models we create. Creating complete web applications that allow users to interact with analyses is cumbersome, to say the least! Enter Streamlit, a Python library for creating web applications built with data folks in mind at every step.</p>
    <p class="normal">Streamlit shortens the development time for the creation of data-focused web applications, allowing data scientists to create web app prototypes in Python in hours instead of days.</p>
    <p class="normal">This book takes a hands-on approach to help you learn the tips and tricks that will have you up and running with Streamlit in no time. You’ll start with the fundamentals of Streamlit by creating a basic app and gradually build on this foundation by producing high-quality graphics with data visualization and testing machine learning models. As you advance through the chapters, you’ll walk through practical examples of both personal and work-related data-focused web applications and learn about more complicated topics such as using Streamlit Components, beautifying your apps, and the quick deployment of your new apps.</p>
    <h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-6">Who this book is for</h1>
    <p class="normal">This book is for data scientists and machine learning engineers or enthusiasts who want to create web apps using Streamlit. Whether you’re a junior data scientist looking to deploy your first machine learning project in Python to improve your resume or a senior data scientist working full time trying to convince your colleagues with dynamic analyses, this book is for you!</p>

    <h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-9">To get the most out of this book</h1>
    <p class="normal">This book assumes that you are at least a Python novice, which means you are comfortable with basic Python syntax and have taken tutorials or classes before in Python. It is also written for users interested in data science, which includes topics such as statistics and machine learning but does not require a data science background. If you know how to make lists and define variables and have written a <code class="inlineCode">for</code> loop before, you have enough Python knowledge to get started!</p>
    <p class="normal">If you are using the digital version of this book, we advise you to type the code yourself or access the code from the book’s GitHub repository (a link is available in the next section). Doing so will help you avoid any potential errors related to the copying and pasting of code.</p>
