    not so positive when managed poorly), the degree of risk of data misuse and mismanagement

- en: The concept of trust is complex. You cannot buy it. You cannot snap your fingers
    and create it. It takes time to create and seconds to lose. What is interesting
    about applying the concept of trust to data is that users of data often presume
    the data is wrong and that they can’t trust it, especially when the data is not
    what they expected it to be. I often joke that “data is guilty until proven innocent,”
    and it is often the way data is treated in practice. As data practitioners, the
    burden falls on our shoulders to prove data is reliable and to drive trust. Our
    colleagues demand it. Our customers demand it. The burden is ours to bear.

    job reaches far beyond simply reporting. **Chief Data and Analytics Officers**
    (**CDAOs**) are truth-tellers, architects, engineers, and monetization leaders.
    Without the broad focus across capabilities, the role of a CDAO dilutes to reporting
    only. You will not build trust by being a reporting shop. Our job is to build
    trust across the organization not just in reports but in data solutions that impact
    business outcomes directly.

    trustworthiness and data protection to be nearly as important as price and delivery
    time*.” It is no longer enough to be the most reasonably priced or have the highest
    quality delivery. Customers want to trust the company and believe their data will
    be protected appropriately while doing business, as well as after the transaction
    occurs. They want to trust *you* to care for their data well. The combination
    of the dramatic increase in the quantity of data and the customer expectation
    to care for their data well puts **Chief Data Officers** (**CDOs**)/CDAOs in the

- en: Because data and analytics are a core tenet of any digital business, CDAOs have
    to take accountability for measurable results tied to business outcomes. You serve
    the company end to end and top to bottom. You have to build support from this
    perspective. Without getting too deep into the foundations of neuropsychology,
    the coalition of advocates you need to build trust in data must start with building
    trust in you. Your colleagues and stakeholders must believe that *you* can bring
    order to chaos. They must believe that you can drive this change. Ultimately,
    the relationships you build early in your program can either make or break your
    success. According to *Gartner*, “*Culture and literacy are the top two roadblocks
    for data and analytics leaders.*” (*10 Ways CDOs Can Succeed in Forging a Data-Driven
    Organization*, published May 22, 2019, Gartner.) These two terms “*culture*” and
    “*literacy*” are thrown around in the data industry constantly.

    traits of a racial, religious, or social group*” [2]. Thus, it’s not about creating
    a data culture; it’s about creating a culture where data is a foundational component
    of the culture of the company: a bias for data over opinion, and facts over feelings.
    It’s about making data a part of the everyday workings of the company – not as
    a separate “data culture,” but woven into the overall culture of the company.'

    data is more important than other components of culture, and I wholeheartedly
    disagree with this approach. I have seen CDAOs fail by pushing this agenda. Instead,
    it’s far more effective to push the integration of data into the culture not as
    a separate initiative but as a part of the company’s DNA.

    competence*” [4]. Thus, the purpose of data literacy programs is to empower the
    company as a whole to be able to read and use data and have competence in data
    use; however, launching a program for data literacy also tends to fall flat. Instead,
    I recommend incorporating data into all programs (that is, policy training, compliance,
    and alongside technical training as a technical competence). Treating the general
    knowledge around data like other general competencies will make the learning feel
    more organic to the average employee, and creating focused training for the technical
    creators (for example, data engineers), makes this focus more natural for the
    company to adopt. Forcing the executive team to sit through “data literacy” programs/trainings
    is often off-putting at best and insulting at worst. Find a way to make this learning
    natural, and you will find the program to be more successful and welcomed.'

    They are not just looking for trust in the results – they are building trust in
    you to deliver those results. There are a few ways you can go about bringing the
    company on your journey to build trust in data. You could drive it as a compliance
    exercise (aka…the “stick” method), which is based on driving data governance activities
    because you “have to” do them. You could do it purely by incentive (aka…the “carrot”
    method), which is based on driving data governance activities through incentives.
    Or, you could build a coalition of advocates and drive data governance from all
    sides. The latter is by far the most effective and the method with the most staying
    power.

    of a customer buying a specific product), a data team often measures the time
    savings they created for the organization by implementing the model, meaning how
    much time was saved by the business from calculating the model manually, versus
    implementing an **artificial intelligence** (**AI**)/**machine learning** (**ML**)-driven
    model produced by the CDAO office’s data science team. While this measure of success
    is a strong one (time savings of manual work versus model use almost always results
    in a positive investment story), it is not the ultimate measure of success. The

    your organization. Ideally, you should seek to obtain full support from the entire
    C-suite. However, you do need at least one (ideally at least two) C-suite member(s)
    who will serve as your executive sponsor(s). Executive sponsors differ from other
    executives in that they will be more hands-on in your overall data governance
    work and should help you navigate gaining support across the organization, including
    obtaining funding. If you are new to your organization, executive sponsors may
    also help you understand how to navigate the organization, what underlying politics
    may exist, and identify who makes investment decisions, and ultimately, prioritization
    decisions.

    deep listening sessions to identify needs across the organization. Now that you

    they have business needs. It sounds simple, but it is a simple driver that is

    the quality of your contact data, as in the preceding use case, it’s far more
    valuable to articulate what the business was able to do because the quality of
    the contact data improved. In this example, we measured the improvement of the
    contact data (which was >40% higher quality) *and* what that meant to our marketing

    that you continue to meet with them during your delivery. Since you should be
    creating the enterprise data strategy while you are delivering for your executive
    sponsor’s domain, you should hold at least quarterly enterprise data committee
    meetings to share progress, prioritize additional needs of the company, and garner
    additional support from the rest of the domain leaders. One of the biggest mistakes
    you can make is meeting at the wrong frequency. There are two extremes to consider:'

    You can adjust as the members of the committee desire. Ask for feedback and continue
    to adjust as needed.

    as possible from your committee members. These are all signs you need to make
    changes regarding the frequency and/or content you are sharing with the group.
    If the membership has shifted, you may need to do a series of 1:1 meetings with
    your members to re-engage them and ask them to return to future cycles of the
    meeting. You likely have one additional chance to re-engage them before they stop
    coming for good.

    you may be able to launch a second data domain on a slightly staggered start date.
    A word of caution: do not start a second data domain unless you are very confident
    you have strong support from the company *and* the delivery of the first data
    domain is going very well. Even then, it is critical that you maximize quality
    over quantity. It is far better to execute well with one domain than to deliver
    against two with mediocre results.'

    spend the appropriate time aligning on roles and responsibilities between your
    team (the business of data), the technology team (the technology of data), and
    the business team (the data domain). This can be accomplished by working with
    the executive data domain leader’s team, the CIO (or their delegate), and your
    team. Working together to define what you are responsible for versus what the
    data domain is responsible for versus what the IT function is responsible for
    upfront will enable better teamwork as you get into delivery together.

    your company’s most executive forum. Some companies refer to this group as the
    C-suite, the executive leadership team, or perhaps e-Staff (for executive staff).
    It may contain only the CEO’s direct reports or it may include additional roles,
    depending on the CEO’s preferences. I recommend having your executive sponsor
    set the stage for you, explaining why they have decided to play a role in your
    success and what value they believe you can bring, and endorse your program before
    they introduce you. This will grab the audience’s attention so that they are focused
    on your presentation. Return to the forum regularly to share wins, adjustments,
    and impacts that you achieve.

    As a board member myself, I often ask questions about data presented in board
    packets and that management is using for decision-making.

    approach, it’s critical we approach building our programs through that same lens:
    one where trust comes first. To build trust with the entirety of the organization,
    you need to show them they can trust you through your delivery. We previously
    discussed the importance of the enterprise data committee, which is critical for
    executive support. In addition, you should create forums and communication mechanisms
    to keep excitement and energy up about what you are doing to transform the company.'

- en: I recommend setting up a forum that does not have a restriction on the “who”
    or “how many” people attend. A broad and open forum is a great place to show what
    has been done versus telling what has been done. As you build capabilities, providing
    a demonstration as to what has been delivered and how the masses can start to
    take advantage and use the capabilities is how you will start to show your delivery
    and gain trust. Remember – you do not gain trust by talking about what you will
    do; you gain trust by showing what you did. Trust is built on actions, not talk.

    and even short video clips to tell the masses what is happening and how delivery
    is progressing. Using a tool such as Confluence® to post key information about
    your transformation (such as your business case!), the roadmap, recent accomplishments,
    links to key artifacts (such as business requirements and technical requirements),
    as well as metrics will save you time in having to hold meetings every time someone
    has a question.

    sponsor, your enterprise data committee, and stakeholders enterprise-wide through
    forums and written communication is creating the energy that will carry you through
    the data governance transformation. It’s your responsibility and honor to unite
    the masses in this way. Very few programs have the ability or the interest to
    unite this broad community in the way you can, by building trust in data. The
    cornerstone of the entire coalition is relationships. Invest early and often to
    drive the results you desire.
