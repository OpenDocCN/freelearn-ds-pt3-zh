    “Master Data” is the prominent term in the industry. “Master” has inherent and
    historical racist roots in “ownership” of something from another source. In the
    data space, this is the act of identifying the single owner of an identifier.
    We have started to see a shift away from the term ‘Master’ in other industries
    (i.e. Master Bedroom in real estate listings, now commonly viewed as “Primary
    Bedroom” or “Grand Bedroom”). I have strong feelings about this term and urge
    the profession as a whole, to change this. My hearty recommendation is that we
    adopt “primary” data, to refer to this type of data.

    is slow-moving data and does not change frequently, once you have the definitions

    due to the slow-moving nature of reference data. Reference data is ‘slow-moving’
    in that it does not change frequently. Consider industry codes such as NAICS codes.
    While there are new and emerging industries, these codes, commonly used for things
    like reporting or sales planning, do not evolve frequently. Thus, NAICS codes
    are updated every five years. Reference data also has a finite limit to the number
    of valid values. For example, there are only so many industry codes or area codes.
    An easy way to understand this is to think about reference data as being something
    you could select from a drop down menu. It could be a very long drop down, but
    a drop down nonetheless. Whereas, primary data (e.g., Customer Data) may have
    an infinite number of records or valid values that increases over time.

    Data often struggle to see a full view of their customer. A tell-tale sign of
    a lack of a Customer Primary Data system is when each division has different information
    about a customer, and it’s difficult to see the full customer journey across your

- en: Before we close out on this topic, I want to leave you with a very specific
    list of Stakeholders, Business Benefits, and KPIs to use as a starting point for
    your business case. You should always customize the list for your own company,
    but I hope you find value in this list as a jumping off point for defining the
    value of your PDM investment. Because these investments are usually multiple millions
    of dollars, involve rearchitecting business processes, implementing new systems,
    and driving new outcomes, they are hard to sell to the business. But, with clear
    business benefits, ROI statements, and measures of success (KPIs), I am confident
    you will be able to launch this capability at your organization.

    product, vendor, or employee data, but a way to streamline and drive efficiency
    and effectiveness across your entire business. PDM is one of the most robust and
    potentially impactful capabilities that data governance can deliver for a company.
