    a program, baseline the organization, and launch and deliver against the plan,
    we need to be able to ensure solutions are used by the business. Driving the adoption
    of data solutions is not a one-time activity, nor does it end after the delivery
    of the program. While there should be initial adoption done during implementation,
    adoption is an ongoing activity that you and your team must master in order to
    ensure maximum impact is realized from data investments.

    value into perpetuity. Your data solutions will live or die based on the post-go-live,
    but most teams stop short of success by considering “go-live” the end milestone.
    This chapter will delve into the crucial, and often overlooked, aspect of data
    governance: adoption. We will explore why driving widespread use of data solutions
    is absolutely critical for maximizing impact and achieving your desired **return

    are collecting and storing momentous amounts of data, recognizing its potential,
    but unfortunately, simply collecting and storing data is not enough. The true
    power of this data comes when it is unlocked through effective solutions. As we
    covered these in the first 14 chapters of this book, you know the key building
    blocks of data governance. You know why these capabilities matter, and you know
    how to discuss their value with stakeholders. Now, we need to focus on further

    answer the occasional question. In the other organization, we published the updated
    policy and drove an implementation plan that included walking the stewards through
    the adoption of the policy and had a much more “in the trenches with you” approach
    versus standing on the sidelines.

    who is impacted by the work you are doing. We often think about the person we
    provide the solution directly to, but when it comes to data solutions, so many
    of the capabilities we drive have a ripple effect. They impact the person we are
    working with directly – yes, but the capabilities impact so many more.

    While the policy is directed (primarily) at stewards and users of data, they aren’t
    the full story. Ultimately, you must think about who else is impacted by the policy:
    the customers, the employees, the users of systems, the readers of reports, the
    executives making decisions, the Board of Directors, and stakeholders across the
    enterprise as a whole (to name a few). I try to put myself in the customers’ shoes.

    deployment itself, but the felt and lived experience of the ultimate individual
    person who is impacted by the success of your team. That person, whom you may
    never speak to and may never know. Impacting their experience is what it is all
    about. The more you can put yourself in the embodiment of their journey, the more
