- en: The rapid visual analysis that is possible using Tableau is incredibly useful
    for answering numerous questions and making key decisions. But it barely scratches
    the surface of the possible analysis. For example, a simple scatterplot can reveal
    outliers, but often, you want to understand the distribution or identify clusters
    of similar observations. A simple time series helps you to see the rise and fall
    of a measure over time, but often, you want to see the trend or make predictions
    for future values.

    for the manipulation and analysis of your data.

    at least as well as the trend model. This is why P-values of 5% or less are typically

    measurements are expected. Tableau gives extensive visibility into the trend models
    and even allows you to export data containing trend model predictions and residuals.
    Clusters enable you to find groups of related data points based on various factors.
    Distributions are useful for understanding a spread of values across a dataset.
