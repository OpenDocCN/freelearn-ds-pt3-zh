			<h1 id="_idParaDest-208"><a id="_idTextAnchor207"/>Primary Data Management</h1>
			<p>One of the core capabilities of any organization is the ability to standardize its most core, most connected data: <strong class="bold">master &amp; reference data</strong>. By nature, mastered data provides a solution whereas data used by multiple divisions for many uses are standardized and cleansed for the benefit of the organization at large. We will start with the basics: What is master data? Why is it critical? What makes it so complex and difficult to deploy and adopt? We will dive into what the different types of data are, and how it varies from customer <span class="No-Break">data platforms.</span></p>
			<p>I will explain how to prioritize this data governance capability and how to implement a strong and centralized master data solution that will impact and elevate the power of data for an enterprise into a strategic asset. All the capabilities introduced thus far will be woven into this powerful capability to tie <span class="No-Break">them together.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Before we dive in; a note on the use of the term “Master Data Management”</p>
			<p class="callout">At the time of this writing, the term and capability commonly referred to as “Master Data” is the prominent term in the industry. “Master” has inherent and historical racist roots in “ownership” of something from another source. In the data space, this is the act of identifying the single owner of an identifier. We have started to see a shift away from the term ‘Master’ in other industries (i.e. Master Bedroom in real estate listings, now commonly viewed as “Primary Bedroom” or “Grand Bedroom”). I have strong feelings about this term and urge the profession as a whole, to change this. My hearty recommendation is that we adopt “primary” data, to refer to this type <span class="No-Break">of data.</span></p>
			<p class="callout">If we are not changing it, we are choosing it. And I don’t want us, as a profession, to continue to buy into this ‘ownership’ of types of data, with roots in racism. I’m choosing to refer to this type of data as “Primary Data” going forward, and I urge you to adopt this term in your companies, so that we can change the <span class="No-Break">industry, together.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-209"><a id="_idTextAnchor208"/>Defining Primary Data Management</h1>
			<p>Primary Data Management<a id="_idIndexMarker593"/> is a core data governance capability, which brings together a core set of processes and technologies that are used to create a single unified view of specific types of data. This capability helps ensure that these specific and critical types of data have, above all else, consistency, accuracy, and accessibility enterprise-wide. Examples of Primary Data include: customer, product, vendor, and contact data. Because these types of data (customer, product, etc.) are often created in various departments across the organization, they require a special handling to unify and provision, so that the entire organization can have the same view of the data. Without Primary Data Management, companies struggle with consistency, accuracy and quality overall, which leads to poor <span class="No-Break">customer experiences.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Example – Customer Experience</p>
			<p class="callout">Imagine <a id="_idIndexMarker594"/>you are a customer of a large financial institution, and you open up a checking account at a branch location. Months later, you call into a 1-800 number, to ask a question about your account. Since the time you opened your checking account, you also opened a mortgage account and moved into a new home. When you call customer service about your checking account, you are asked to verify your address for security purposes. Only there’s one problem, your address on your checking account is your <span class="No-Break">previous address.</span></p>
			<p class="callout">Without customer primary data management, customer addresses are not updated across the enterprise when new products are sold to a customer. In this situation, you might be required to go into your local branch to formally update your address, instead of having it updated automatically, through the use of primary data <span class="No-Break">management capabilities.</span></p>
			<p>Primary Data Management is one of the more complex capabilities to establish in an enterprise, especially a large one. However, once fully adopted, this capability has the most significant impact on your organization’s ability to deliver operational efficiency at scale. Establishing a <strong class="bold">Primary Data Management (PDM)</strong> capability enables your <span class="No-Break">organization</span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker595"/></span><span class="No-Break"> to:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Identify and Consolidate</strong>. Establishing a PDM capability enables your company to identify the sources of the primary data, consolidate the data into a single process, and then replicate the databack to the original source better than when it came into the capability. This removes data silos and enables the entire company to work off of the same accurate <span class="No-Break">data set.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Clean and Enrich</strong>. By<a id="_idIndexMarker596"/> bringing the Primary Data into the central capability, the company is able to clean the data by evaluating the data quality, remediating issues with the data, and enriching the data with 3<span class="superscript">rd</span> party data, thus elevating the quality and reliability of the data. This process removes inconsistencies, errors, and missing data. You can also add additional data to the records (e.g., demographic information, <span class="No-Break">compliance flags).</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Standardize and Govern</strong>. Primary Data Management enables organizations to standardize and govern their primary data by creating and enforcing data quality rules to ensure data is consistent, accurate, and reliable. PDM drives trust in the company’s most critical and <span class="No-Break">core data.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Sharing</strong>. Because Primary Data is centrally cared for and provisioned across the company, PDM processes make it easier for companies to share high-quality primary data enterprise-wide into other systems that require highly trusted data. This allows organizations to enable high-quality decision-making based on uniform data across <span class="No-Break">the company.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In the section below on the Core Capabilities, we will explore how to enable these capabilities in your PDM deployment and garner the full value of the <span class="No-Break">PDM investment.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-210"><a id="_idTextAnchor209"/>Reference Data</h2>
			<p>Reference Data Management<a id="_idIndexMarker597"/> is a type of standardized data that drives uniformity across an organization. Examples of Reference Data are consistent across companies such as: zip codes, city names, industry codes (e.g., NAICS or SIC), or may be consistent for a particular company such as a chart of accounts. Regardless of what your reference data set is, these codes are considered a type of primary data because the company is following the same characteristics for primary data, including consolidation and standardization, central enrichment, deduplication, and simplification (meaning, the data is sourced and managed by a central team in service of the broader organization). Externally derived reference data can be sourced through government entities (e.g., Postal Codes) or through 3<span class="superscript">rd</span> parties (e.g., Dun &amp; Bradstreet). There are many providers of <span class="No-Break">reference data.</span></p>
			<p>A common business<a id="_idIndexMarker598"/> sponsor for Reference Data Management is your Finance Department. Generally, Finance is the central point of aggregation of information on various factors such as geography, industry, etc., all of which can be improved through conformity of reference data. Reference Data transformation typically comes up as a part of another major transformation, usually an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) transformation, where the company is forced to review all of its core data to run operations, report on financials, and provide <span class="No-Break">regulatory reports.</span></p>
			<p>In every company I have deployed Reference Data, the need for this generally comes up in release planning for ERP or Financial Statement design processes. The finance team realizes they have multiple conflicting versions of Reference Data, and need support to conform the data to a standard model. This is where the data team is usually brought in. Reference Data can typically be deployed rather quickly. Once you purchase software and can stand up the base capabilities, publishing the Reference Data isn’t all that difficult. Because Reference Data is slow-moving data and does not change frequently, once you have the definitions defined, a steward identified, and have the capability to publish the data, actually putting the data into production is a relatively quick process (especially compared to other types of <span class="No-Break">Primary Data).</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-211"><a id="_idTextAnchor210"/>Primary Data versus Reference Data</h2>
			<p>While <a id="_idIndexMarker599"/>reference data is a type of primary data, it is typically managed separately due to the slow-moving<a id="_idIndexMarker600"/> nature of reference data. Reference data is ‘slow-moving’ in that it does not change frequently. Consider industry codes such as NAICS codes. While there are new and emerging industries, these codes, commonly used for things like reporting or sales planning, do not evolve frequently. Thus, NAICS codes are updated every five years. Reference data also has a finite limit to the number of valid values. For example, there are only so many industry codes or area codes. An easy way to understand this is to think about reference data as being something you could select from a drop down menu. It could be a<a id="_idIndexMarker601"/> very long drop down, but a drop down nonetheless. Whereas, primary data (e.g., Customer Data) may<a id="_idIndexMarker602"/> have an infinite number of records or valid values that increases <span class="No-Break">over time.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-212"><a id="_idTextAnchor211"/>Types of Primary Data</h1>
			<p>In addition to Reference Data, there are other types of Primary Data. Primary Data is managed by type. Each <a id="_idIndexMarker603"/>type has a platform or system that is independent from the other types. However, each of these types may include some relevant reference data. For example, customer data may contain the customer’s zip code, which may be selected from the valid values defined in the Reference <span class="No-Break">Data system.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-213"><a id="_idTextAnchor212"/>Customer</h2>
			<p>Customer Primary Data is <a id="_idIndexMarker604"/>all the buzz in customer-facing divisions (e.g., Sales, Marketing, Revenue). Companies <a id="_idIndexMarker605"/>who have not standardized their Customer Primary Data often struggle to see a full view of their customer. A tell-tale sign of a lack of a Customer Primary Data system is when each division has different information about a customer, and it’s difficult to see the full customer journey across your company. Sales may have different information about a customer (like address) than revenue than operations than marketing. This is a great signal that your company would benefit from having Customer Primary Data implemented and deployed to unify the information about a customer for <span class="No-Break">your organization.</span></p>
			<p>Customer data can be sourced from a variety of sources including directly from the customer, from 3<span class="superscript">rd</span> party enrichment services, from social media services like LinkedIn, and from marketing and events. Contact data (which we will discuss below) is also a great source for customer data. You may also source customer information from the sales process through <span class="No-Break">order management.</span></p>
			<p>Typical sponsors for customer data are usually Sales, Customer Success, or Sales Operations. Because this data is spread across these areas primarily, assigning an Executive Data Domain Leader for this capability is often the most difficult over other types of Primary Data. In my experience, it usually comes down to political power within the organization and funding. Whichever team has more power, authority, and budget often becomes the<a id="_idIndexMarker606"/> sponsor. A word of caution: It is relatively easy for that sponsor to then ensure the Customer Primary Data Management platform is in service of their needs over<a id="_idIndexMarker607"/> the needs of others. You are responsible for ensuring the data out of this platform serves the company, not just one division. A great way to combat this bias is to use existing governance routines and rhythms (like your Enterprise Data Committee) to codify the release schedule and the needs of the business in <span class="No-Break">priority order.</span></p>
			<p>Customer Primary Data Management usually becomes a priority when the sales and customer service teams begin to see lower quality scores from sales professionals, customer service representatives, and customers related to their experiences. Low quality and contradictory customer data makes it hard for sales professionals to process deals, to renew contracts, and to use the correct information to engage with a customer. Imagine being in the field, ready to call a customer, but having no phone number in the customer relationship management platform. Happens all <span class="No-Break">the time.</span></p>
			<p>As companies grow and their data is disbursed in more systems and platforms, keeping the data consistent becomes harder. Since customers are at the center of what companies do, having good quality, highly reliable customer information to run your business is <span class="No-Break">more important.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-214"><a id="_idTextAnchor213"/>Product</h2>
			<p>Like <a id="_idIndexMarker608"/>customer data, product data is centralized, unform data that is required to manage product information. Product primary data<a id="_idIndexMarker609"/> may include information such as product name, product description, product characteristics (e.g., color, weight, dimensions), manufacturer, model, price, and pictures. This information is used by a variety of departments such as sales, operations, supply chain management, and revenue <span class="No-Break">operations teams.</span></p>
			<p>Product primary data can be <a id="_idIndexMarker610"/>stored in a variety <a id="_idIndexMarker611"/>of<a id="_idIndexMarker612"/> places, including <strong class="bold">enterprise resource planning (ERP)</strong> systems, <strong class="bold">product information systems (PIS)</strong>, and <strong class="bold">customer relationship management (CRM)</strong> systems. However, it is important to have a single, central repository for a product’s primary data to ensure that you have accuracy and consistency across all <span class="No-Break">consuming systems.</span></p>
			<p>Product data is often sourced from a variety of places as well, including supplier catalogs, websites, ERP systems, as well as internal production data. This is one of the reasons that primary data is so critical to managing well: the data is sourced from a variety of <a id="_idIndexMarker613"/>locations, is standardized and enriched in a single location (the primary data platform), and then pushed to the systems that need the data. If there was no primary data platform, then each individual <a id="_idIndexMarker614"/>system would need to do this work individually, leading to a huge increase in cost, complexity, and a high degree of inconsistency across systems, making aggregation and reporting <span class="No-Break">extraordinary difficult.</span></p>
			<p>Typical business sponsors for product data include engineering or product management, legal and compliance or revenue operations. Because it is highly universal across a company, and varies heavily based on industry, Product Primary Data, like Customer Primary Data, is a bit more difficult to identify the sponsor. Follow the same process outlined above for Customer Primary Data, and use your governance councils to aid you in nailing down <span class="No-Break">a sponsor.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-215"><a id="_idTextAnchor214"/>Vendor [or Supplier]</h2>
			<p>Vendor Primary Data Management (sometimes referred to as Supplier Primary Data] is a primary <a id="_idIndexMarker615"/>data <a id="_idIndexMarker616"/>platform that is specialized<a id="_idIndexMarker617"/> in goods and/or services providers that a company purchases from. It may include key information such as vendor name, address, company or industry code data, terms of payment, currency <span class="No-Break">used, etc.</span></p>
			<p>Vendor Primary Data is used for a variety of functions across an organization including procurement, accounts payable, supply chain management, and may also be used by HR for contractor information. The data from this platform may be consumed by ERP systems, procurement systems, and supplier relationship management systems. Like other primary data platforms, there are many potential sources for this data, and many potential consuming systems for this data. This drives the need to centrally manage the <span class="No-Break">information well.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-216"><a id="_idTextAnchor215"/>Contact</h2>
			<p>Contact Primary Data <a id="_idIndexMarker618"/>is a single, unified<a id="_idIndexMarker619"/> view of all of a company’s contacts, which can include customers, prospects (i.e., leads), employees, vendors, and partners. The contact data includes information such as the name of the contact, address phone number, email address, and company affiliation. Contact primary data is often used by a wide range of departments in a company, such as sales, marketing, accounting, customer service, and human resources. Sponsorship for Contact Primary Data is typically in Marketing, given their role to acquire and create qualified leads for the company, <span class="No-Break">through contact.</span></p>
			<p>Contact Primary Data is<a id="_idIndexMarker620"/> used for a variety of business <span class="No-Break">processes, including:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Lead Generation</strong>. Contact Primary Data is used to identify and market to <span class="No-Break">potential customers.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Sales and Marketing Campaigns</strong>. Contact Primary Data is used to create and execute marketing campaigns that are targeted to <span class="No-Break">potential customers.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Customer Service</strong>. Contact Primary Data is used to provide customer support and resolve <span class="No-Break">customer issues.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Human Resources</strong>. Contact Primary Data is used to manage employee records and recruit <span class="No-Break">new employees.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Accounting</strong>. Contact Primary Data is used to pay expenses <span class="No-Break">and suppliers.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Contact Primary Data is stored in a wide range of systems, including CRMs, ERPs, and HR systems. Data is sourced from a variety of sources such as business cards, email lists, social media, contacts themselves, event <span class="No-Break">registrations, etc.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-217"><a id="_idTextAnchor216"/>Building an Optimal Primary Data Management Capability: Core Capabilities for Success</h1>
			<p>One of the biggest<a id="_idIndexMarker621"/> misconceptions about Primary Data Management is surrounding what capabilities qualify a platform or system to be considered a Primary Data Management capability versus any other platform. There are a few core capabilities that are unique to a PDM system, and<a id="_idIndexMarker622"/> without these capabilities, you have not yet implemented a true PDM. It is common for non-experts to use the term “master” or “primary” to define a system of record, or simply a system that is the ‘preferred’ source for that particular type of data. That alone does not make a PDM. To be a PDM, a system must include the capabilities in this section, starting <span class="No-Break">with deduplication.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-218"><a id="_idTextAnchor217"/>De-duping or Deduplication</h2>
			<p>Also<a id="_idIndexMarker623"/> known as ‘Match and Merge’, <strong class="bold">Deduplication</strong> in Primary Data Management is the process of<a id="_idIndexMarker624"/> identifying and then merging duplicate data records. If your PDM Platform does not provide this capability, you do not have a PDM. This capability is a critical part of PDM because <a id="_idIndexMarker625"/>it ensures that the organization’s data is accurate, consistent, and complete. Duplicate data can be created for a number of reasons, but often stems from similar data being entered into multiple systems, being entered in incorrectly, being updated differently in different systems or being sourced from different places (i.e., LinkedIn versus from an event <span class="No-Break">attendance roster).</span></p>
			<h3>Approaches to Deduplication</h3>
			<p>There are <a id="_idIndexMarker626"/>few ways that a PDM system can approach deduplication to achieve the desired outcome of a single record for each customer, product, vendor, <span class="No-Break">or contact.</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong class="bold">Fuzzy Logic</strong>. Fuzzy logic is a type of artificial intelligence that is used to match data records that are not exact duplicates. The logic looks for errors such as typos, abbreviations and <span class="No-Break">varying formats.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Matching Algorithms</strong>. Matching algorithms compare records to identify those that are likely to be duplicates using a variety of factors such as name, address, phone number, and <span class="No-Break">email address.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Human Review</strong>. Human review is often necessary in PDM capabilities to confirm whether or not two records are duplicates. There is a degree of human review needed for unmatched records, and depending on the quality of your fuzzy logic or matching algorithms, you may need a high or low amount of human review. This is often the primary driver in the size of your PDM operations team, to review potential duplicate records that were not matched through the previous to <span class="No-Break">deduplication methods.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>You can see how <a id="_idIndexMarker627"/>well your deduplication process is working by measuring the number of ‘unmatched’ records, meaning, how many records you begin with before deduplication processes begin. This is the aggregate of the number of records are entering the PDM system from source systems. For a large enterprise, this may be 100-200 million records or more. Let’s take a look at a <span class="No-Break">simple example.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer055" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18846_10_1.jpg" alt="Figure 10.1 – Example Deduplication Process"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.1 – Example Deduplication Process</p>
			<p>In the example<a id="_idIndexMarker628"/> above, we are sourcing data from three different systems, each claiming to have customer data. As you can see, each system has a different record count for customers. In each system, there may be duplications within each platform as well as across platforms. When we send the data to the PDM platform in the middle, where the deduplication process is run (see “Deduplication Process” above, just one of many core capabilities in the PDM), that process standardizes and deduplicates common records across all records the <span class="No-Break">PDM consumes.</span></p>
			<p>When the<a id="_idIndexMarker629"/> data is pushed out to the consuming systems on the right, they all receive the updated customer records, deduplicated and ready for use. You can set up your data flows so that the sources on the left also receive the updated deduplicated<a id="_idIndexMarker630"/> data, but that is up to you and your <span class="No-Break">business needs.</span></p>
			<h4>Metrics to Measure Success (Internal – Data Team)</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Reduction in duplicate <span class="No-Break">records (count)</span></li>
				<li>Improved data <span class="No-Break">storage efficiency</span></li>
				<li>Cost savings <span class="No-Break">in storage</span></li>
				<li>Time saved managing duplicated or <span class="No-Break">redundant data</span></li>
				<li>Improved <span class="No-Break">data quality</span></li>
				<li>Accuracy of Customer Count (<span class="No-Break">improvement score)</span></li>
			</ol>
			<h4>Metrics to Measure Success (External – Stakeholder)</h4>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Improved <a id="_idIndexMarker631"/>accuracy <span class="No-Break">in analytics</span></li>
				<li>Improved Customer Success Scores (from call center representatives being able to identify customers more easily and see a more unified, accurate view of <span class="No-Break">the customer)</span></li>
				<li>Reduced Costs (e.g., enrichment costs in a single location vs. many. Often companies buy the same enrichment service multiple times without <span class="No-Break">realizing it.)</span></li>
				<li>Reduction in marketing costs (from marketing to valid contacts a single time versus multiple times, or with bad <span class="No-Break">contact information)</span></li>
			</ol>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-219"><a id="_idTextAnchor218"/>Common Definitions</h2>
			<p>One of the <a id="_idIndexMarker632"/>first steps in establishing a strong Primary Data system is to align the company on common definitions. First, you need to define what a customer is for your organization. Sounds simple, but is <span class="No-Break">quite complicated.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Customer Data Definition Trouble</p>
			<p class="callout">The first Customer Primary Data Management deployment I was a part of, we spent 18 months (not a joke!) working across the company to define what a customer was. We argued across definitions on elements such as whether the customer needed to be active, or if having a purchase within the last 12 months was sufficient. What did it mean to be “active”? What did they need to purchase? Was simply having an open account sufficient? What if there are no deposits in their account (<span class="No-Break">for example)?</span></p>
			<p class="callout">In my second Customer Primary Data Management deployment I worked on, I went straight to the Data Domain Executive for Customer Data, and proposed a definition to him. He made one minor tweak, we approved it together, and we announced the definition to the relevant stakeholders. It took less than 18 minutes. A stark contrast from my <span class="No-Break">first experience.</span></p>
			<p class="callout">What’s the right approach? You need to make that decision for your company. But I would recommend you use your Data Governance routines and reporting processes to codify the definitions early before you get into the meta model design to limit <span class="No-Break">rework later.</span></p>
			<p>You will need to set a <a id="_idIndexMarker633"/>process to define what each data attribute for a <a id="_idIndexMarker634"/>Customer Record will be <strong class="bold">rationalized</strong> (others may call this process ‘mastered’ or ‘mastering’, but like the type of data, I am aiming to use a more inclusive term). For each attribute, you will need a definition to be aligned across the company so that when you refer to them in reports, in the system, and in your data catalog or dictionary, you have a common vocabulary <span class="No-Break">and understanding.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-220"><a id="_idTextAnchor219"/>Golden Source Attribution</h2>
			<p>Your<a id="_idIndexMarker635"/> Primary Data Management platform will have a finite set of attributes that you rationalize for each record. This is not the time to put 200 attributes into your primary data platform. Remember the purpose is to standardize the core attributes or common attributes that you intend to drive consistency with across your organization. It is not intended to be a customer data platform. We will walk through the differences in more detail later in this chapter, but for now, be mindful that this is simply the core data related to a customer, not all data related to <span class="No-Break">a customer.</span></p>
			<p>Based on my past experience, I would aim to rationalize no more than 50 core attributes about a Customer. That may seem like a lot or maybe not, depending on your company. The number can grow quickly, especially when you start to think of common attributes <span class="No-Break">such as:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Customer Unique <span class="No-Break">ID Number</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">First Name</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Last Name</span></li>
				<li>Shipping Street Address <span class="No-Break">Line 1</span></li>
				<li>Shipping Street Address Line 2 (note: may include apartment numbers or <span class="No-Break">building numbers)</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Shipping City</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Shipping State</span></li>
				<li>Shipping <span class="No-Break">Zip Code</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Shipping Country</span></li>
				<li>Mailing Street Address <span class="No-Break">Line 1</span></li>
				<li>Mailing Street Address <span class="No-Break">Line 2</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Mailing City</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Mailing State</span></li>
				<li>Mailing <span class="No-Break">Zip Code</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Mailing Country</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Country Code</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Area Code</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Phone Number</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>As you can see, this can grow quickly when you start to include variances like shipping vs. mailing address (+6 new attributes). Your business model will drive the types of attributes you need (B2B or B2C) as well as your industry (e.g., is gender and/or sex assigned at birth relevant for your product? It may be if you are in health care, but likely not if you are in <span class="No-Break">technology sales).</span></p>
			<p>For each <a id="_idIndexMarker636"/>of these attributes, you will need to define the meaning behind each attribute. I also recommend that you take this moment in your program to identify who the data steward is for each of these attributes. It may vary. For example, you may have a data steward for customer first name, customer last name, and mailing address attributes in sales, but your shipping attributes may come from fulfillment or your revenue operations teams. Each attribute should be assigned a data steward who will own and care for <span class="No-Break">that data.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-221"><a id="_idTextAnchor220"/>Hierarchies</h2>
			<p>Hierarchies<a id="_idIndexMarker637"/> are one of the<a id="_idIndexMarker638"/> foundational capabilities behind Primary Data. One of the unique features of Primary Data is the ability to <a id="_idIndexMarker639"/>provide <strong class="bold">multiple hierarchy management</strong> across a company. Multiple Hierarchy Management is the ability to apply multiple ways to roll up the same base data that has been standardized (or rationalized) to meet unique business needs. Common hierarchies for Customer <span class="No-Break">Data include:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Legal <span class="No-Break">Entity Hierarchy</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Sales Hierarchy</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Account Hierarchies</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Location Hierarchies</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Organizational Hierarchies</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Hierarchies <a id="_idIndexMarker640"/>also need business data stewards and technical data stewards. Business data stewards should define what the definition of the hierarchy is, and what the rules of the hierarchy are. Some could be defined by a 3<span class="superscript">rd</span> party (e.g., legal entity) vs. others being defined by the business and unique to each company (e.g., Sales Hierarchy – which is how a company divides out which customers are in which <span class="No-Break">sales territory).</span></p>
			<p>Organizations<a id="_idIndexMarker641"/> could have an infinite number of hierarchies, but I recommend you deploy and manage a minimum number of hierarchies. They can be quite complex to manage given the speed of business and changes required. If your company is on a quarterly sales cycle, they may carve the sales territory quarterly, and thus, your Sales Hierarchy could change as often <span class="No-Break">as quarterly.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Remember</p>
			<p class="callout">The objective of PDM is to standardize commonly used data for your organization, so, if you deploy multiple versions of a single hierarchy type, you are violating the core tenant of primary data <span class="No-Break">management: standardization.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-222"><a id="_idTextAnchor221"/>Trust Logic</h2>
			<p>For<a id="_idIndexMarker642"/> each Primary Data Management <a id="_idIndexMarker643"/>platform you build, you will define <strong class="bold">Trust Logic</strong>. Trust Logic is the way in which rules and processes are used to determine the trustworthiness of your primary data. It is important to the success of your data model because it defines how your data will be brought together to drive accuracy, consistency, and reliability. Every company has a unique way of defining this trust logic, and the resulting model, and should be patented due to its proprietary nature. Especially if unique techniques are used, you should consider protecting <span class="No-Break">this model.</span></p>
			<p>As you are defining your Trust Logic, you will want to look at the raw data from the source systems you’ve identified. For <a id="_idIndexMarker644"/>example, let’s assume you have identified just two desired sources within your company that will be providing data for your Customer Primary Data Management platform. You take a look at System 1 and you see the data looks something <span class="No-Break">like this:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer056" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18846_10_2.jpg" alt="" role="presentation"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Figure">Table 10.1 – Source Data: System 1</p>
			<p>That same <a id="_idIndexMarker645"/>data in System 2 may look something <span class="No-Break">like this:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer057" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18846_10_3.jpg" alt="Table 10.2 – Source Data: System 2"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Table 10.2 – Source Data: System 2</p>
			<p>We also <a id="_idIndexMarker646"/>have standardization issues across these <span class="No-Break">two systems:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Mary and Meredith are inconsistent for the customer’s first name. How will we know which is the correct name? Are these the same person? Or are they two people at the <span class="No-Break">same address?</span></li>
				<li>There is no zip code for the second customer in either system. How will we find <span class="No-Break">this information?</span></li>
				<li>System 2 only has 1 address line, and thus, apartment number is appended to the mailing address field vs. being in a second field in <span class="No-Break">system 1</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Now, if these were the only two customers we had, we might be able to call each one and validate their accurate information and correct this data manually. What if you have a thousand customers? What if you have a million? 150 million? Manually correcting data is no longer scalable. That is why we need automated Primary Data Management capabilities to help us to improve the quality and reliability of this core data at speed and scale of <span class="No-Break">our businesses.</span></p>
			<p>Our first step to define the Trust Logic, is to define which system we will use as the source for each attribute. Each attribute can be defined independently of the others. To illustrate this example, I am going to use two shades of grey to depict the variance in the table below, showing how we have sourced the data in this example. Remember, you may have thousands or millions of rows vs. my example with just <span class="No-Break">two records.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer058" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18846_10_4.jpg" alt="Table 10.3 – Illustrative View of Where Each Attribute Was Sourced"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Table 10.3 – Illustrative View of Where Each Attribute Was Sourced</p>
			<p>In this example, the<a id="_idIndexMarker647"/> First Name attribute and Last Name attribute were sourced from System 2, whereas the remaining five fields were sourced from System 1. Why? In short—it’s up to<a id="_idIndexMarker648"/> you. Usually there is a degree of data quality assessment for the various systems to determine which as the higher <span class="No-Break">quality data.</span></p>
			<p>Another factor in the Trust Logic is, you can also define that secondary systems are used when the first system selected provides a null or blank. For example, if the First Name for System 2 had a blank, you can configure your trust logic to pull System 2 data for First Name attribute first, and if null, pull in First Name data from System 1. You can define 1:M sources for each attribute and define which order you want the data to be pulled in from. This unique Trust Logic is specific to <span class="No-Break">your organization.</span></p>
			<h3>Considerations</h3>
			<p>There are many<a id="_idIndexMarker649"/> factors to consider as you are building your trust logic. To determine which sources are being trusted first, second, third, and so on, should consider <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>The Source System. If the system that provides the data has higher integrity than another systems, you might consider consuming the data from the system with higher integrity <span class="No-Break">over another.</span></li>
				<li>Age of Data. Older data tends to be less trustworthy than more recent data, as it’s more likely to be out of date <span class="No-Break">or inaccurate.</span></li>
				<li>Completeness. Incomplete data may be less trustworthy than complete data sets. You may want to consider if a source has more <span class="No-Break">complete information.</span></li>
				<li>Consistency. Data<a id="_idIndexMarker650"/> that is more consistent with other data is more likely to <span class="No-Break">be trustworthy.</span></li>
				<li>Changes. Data that is changed frequently is less likely to be trustworthy than data that is <span class="No-Break">more stable.</span></li>
				<li>How the Data Was Collected. For example, if data was collected on a sign-up sheet manually, versus digitally acquired, the digital data is more likely to be accurate in <span class="No-Break">most cases.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>How does it work?</h3>
			<p>Trust logic<a id="_idIndexMarker651"/> can be used to assign a trust score to each data attribute by source system. The score can then be used to determine how the data should be used in its deduplication process, and how trustworthy the attribute is. Trust logic can also be used to automate data quality processes. The logic can be sued to automatically identify data that is inaccurate before it infiltrates the Primary Data Management deduplication process. This can help improve the overall quality of the Primary Data to make it <span class="No-Break">more reliable.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-223"><a id="_idTextAnchor222"/>Integration</h2>
			<p>When<a id="_idIndexMarker652"/> creating a Primary Data Management platform, one of the early steps in defining the target architecture (even conceptually) is identifying the integrations that are required. I often think about this in terms of left to right (left being the incoming integrations and the right side being the outgoing integrations). Integrations are no longer so simple. Many of the platforms that will be coming into your platform from the left side of the diagram, are also going to receive the output. This is<a id="_idIndexMarker653"/> called bi-directional integration. It is bi-directional because the data comes into the Primary Data Management platform is standardized, deduplicated, enriched and then pushed back to the <span class="No-Break">source system.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer059" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18846_10_5.jpg" alt="Figure 10.2 – Example of Integration Model"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.2 – Example of Integration Model</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-224"><a id="_idTextAnchor223"/>Quality Third-Party Enrichment</h2>
			<p>Third-party enrichment <a id="_idIndexMarker654"/>services are data files that are purchased from organizations outside of your own. The purpose of using a third-party enrichment service is to improve the quality of the data you have inside <span class="No-Break">your company.</span></p>
			<p>Back to our example, in the second record of our Customer Primary Data platform, we were missing a Zip Code for Meredith Long. A 3<span class="superscript">rd</span> party address enrichment service could be used to enrich the quality of addresses in your Customer Primary Data Management Platform. The resulting output could look <span class="No-Break">like this:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer060" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18846_10_6.jpg" alt="Table 10.4 – Example of Enriched Addresses"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Table 10.4 – Example of Enriched Addresses</p>
			<p>In this example, the enrichment service was able to provide the correct zip code for the second record. Again, remember a simple search could be used to populate 1 missing field, but when you are operating at the scale of a large enterprise, these services replace thousands of hours of manual data quality clean up by using 3<span class="superscript">rd</span> party enrichment to improve the quality of <span class="No-Break">your data.</span></p>
			<p>During the<a id="_idIndexMarker655"/> course of building out your customer and contact primary data, you may find you subscribe to dozens of 3<span class="superscript">rd</span> party enrichment services, to ensure you have the highest quality data possible. Each service has its own pros and cons, so be clear up front in what you are trying to achieve with each enrichment. They can contradict each other. Make sure you have clear processes in place to assess the quality of the enrichment service, which ones you will trust over others, and how that fits into your match and <span class="No-Break">merge processes.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-225"><a id="_idTextAnchor224"/>Consumption Model</h2>
			<p>As a part <a id="_idIndexMarker656"/>of your Primary Data Management program, you will need to define how you will prescribe users to consume the data. Because of the nature of Primary Data, it is important that you take extra care in preventing poor quality data from entering into your PDM platforms. Thus, providing a standardized pattern for consumption will help your users receive what they need without compromising <span class="No-Break">the platform.</span></p>
			<p>Typically, you will be serving both operational and analytical user needs. This means that you will need to define the needs for these types of users and support consumption models for both. For example, for your operational use cases, you may need to consider regulatory reporting requirements like Sarbanes-Oxley but for analytical purposes, you may be able to support a less formalized and rigid control framework which enables you to move data faster and more seamlessly for <span class="No-Break">analytical purposes.</span></p>
			<p>It is likely you will push your Primary Data into a Data Lake and/or Data Warehouse to support analytics, while you push the data into your ERP and CRM for operational needs. You may also provide a pub/sub option for additional distribution of data across <span class="No-Break">your ecosystem.</span></p>
			<p>I recommend defining the consumption model for your company’s needs, and enforcing a policy and technical process by which data cannot be further provisioned so that you maintain the data technical integrity of the data. If you do not enforce a strict consumption model, you risk re-creating the problem in which you set to solve: inconsistent primary data across <span class="No-Break">the enterprise.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-226"><a id="_idTextAnchor225"/>CRM vs. PDM</h1>
			<p>It is very <a id="_idIndexMarker657"/>common for technologists and business users alike to confuse these two types of platforms. To clear up a few <a id="_idIndexMarker658"/>misconceptions: these platforms do not compete with each other. Quite the contrary, they help support one another. Think about the CRM and PDM as being heart and lungs for a human. Both required, both need to work well for optimal health. The same is true for CRM and PDM. They are required to optimize <span class="No-Break">each other.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-227"><a id="_idTextAnchor226"/>What is CRM?</h2>
			<p>A <a id="_idIndexMarker659"/>Customer Relationship Management Platform or CRM Platform, is a system that enables sellers, customer service teams, and marketers to see a 360 degree view of a customer. CRMs help companies track their customer interactions, manage sales, provide customer support, and automate marketing campaigns. CRMs help businesses improve customer satisfaction, increase sales, reduce costs, improve operations, and make better <span class="No-Break">business decisions.</span></p>
			<p>While CRMs do tend to house much of the data attributes that are generally found in a Customer Primary Data Management platform, CRMs are not designed or generally governed in a way that fosters enrichment and reusability for the data for the entirety of use cases across a company. CRMs tend to be biased towards the sales cycle, versus regulatory or risk reporting purposes, analytics, or <span class="No-Break">revenue operations.</span></p>
			<p>According to Gartner, “CRM leaders who avoid MDM will derive erroneous results that annoy customers, resulting in a 25% reduction in potential <span class="No-Break">revenue gains”[1].</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-228"><a id="_idTextAnchor227"/>Key Differences</h2>
			<p>There are some simple and profound differences between a CRM and a PDM platform. A CRM system can be used to identify and prioritize leads, while an PDM system will be used to ensure that the lead is accurate and complete. A CRM will be used to track customer interactions and purchases, while a PDM will be used to create the single view of the <a id="_idIndexMarker660"/>customer information. A <a id="_idIndexMarker661"/>PDM platform will be used to create and manage hierarchies, where the CRM system will consume the hierarchies and create more targeted marketing campaigns and product recommendations from the <span class="No-Break">hierarchy information.</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Table 10.5 - Differences between a CRM and a PDM platform</p>
			<p>Both platforms are of value to an organization, but they serve different users, with different capabilities. Both are better off when <span class="No-Break">used together.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-229"><a id="_idTextAnchor228"/>The Value of Primary Data Management</h1>
			<p>One <a id="_idIndexMarker662"/>of the most difficult challenges of Primary Data Management isn’t the deployment of the platform or the complex integrations. It’s actually the build out of the business case, which includes clearly articulating the value of a Primary Data Management investment. Because of the nature of the complexity of any Primary Data Management platform (regardless of customer, contact, vendor, etc.), the number of sources, and the number of adoptions, it can be difficult for business stakeholders to understand how such a large financial investment will result in <span class="No-Break">business outcomes.</span></p>
			<p>Most PDM investments fail when the business value is not clearly documented early in the program. In more challenging implementations, the reason the company struggled to understand the value of the investment, was when the business case we largely driven from a technology lens versus a business lens. While there is good reason to invest in PDM from a purely IT perspective (efficiency alone is a strong factor), because the cost tends to be quite high relative to other investments, business users tend to struggle to understand why it is a priority, and PDM tends to be bumped down on the list of investment priorities as <span class="No-Break">a result.</span></p>
			<p>On the contrary, when a strong and well-articulated business value story is created, I have seen PDM investments rise to the very top of the priority investment list. My advice: Spend the time articulating the business value story thoroughly before taking it forward. The strength in the business case will carry you over the long duration of the implementation and through adoption of the data into consuming systems down <span class="No-Break">the road.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-230"><a id="_idTextAnchor229"/>Building the Business Case</h2>
			<p>When <a id="_idIndexMarker663"/>writing the business case, I recommend working very closely with the consumers of the data (your stakeholders) to define the business objectives &amp; outcomes that are expected from delivering strong Primary Data Management solutions. First, define a strong purpose statement that will support the <span class="No-Break">program development.</span></p>
			<p>For example, you may want to say <span class="No-Break">something like:</span></p>
			<p class="author-quote"> “Our Primary Data Management Program will deliver fundamental and foundational data management capabilities to enable the company’s transformation and empower employees, customers, and partners with highly reliable, trustworthy information when they need it.”</p>
			<p>It’s <a id="_idIndexMarker664"/>hard to argue with a purpose statement like this. Most stakeholders will agree, but also challenge you to be more specific. That’s where your objectives come in. You should define 3-5 core objectives for the PDM Program, that will be your core focus in delivering for your stakeholders. Some <span class="No-Break">examples include:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Establish clear, aligned definitions and implement a unified customer data model, with high quality and enriched customer data fit for <span class="No-Break">enterprise-wide use.</span></li>
				<li>Create a single-unified view of a customer, including a unique identifier, golden-source attribution for each customer at the most granular level, with multi-hierarchy management to support the needs of sales, marketing, customer support, and revenue operations, with consistency <span class="No-Break">and trust.</span></li>
				<li>Establish a unified view of products, including a unique identifier, golden-source attribution and hierarchy relationship management to support product families, selling, and <span class="No-Break">attribute-based pricing.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-231"><a id="_idTextAnchor230"/>A Note on Scope of Program</h2>
			<p>You<a id="_idIndexMarker665"/> should be very clear about what is in the program (what will be delivered) versus what will be a part of post-program business as usual (BAU) work. For example, it is common to have adoption of the data published by a primary data management platform be a part of the initial program, but not for every system in the company, forever. Companies tend to deploy new technologies somewhat regularly, and if you keep your PDM Program up and running to support indefinitely, you will never finish the program. I recommend having the first few or key system adoption within the program, and once you have proven your approach to drive adoption (that is, consumption) of the data into target systems to be effective, you can complete the program and push everything else <span class="No-Break">into BAU.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-232"><a id="_idTextAnchor231"/>Capability Statements</h2>
			<p>As you <a id="_idIndexMarker666"/>build out the program, you should clarify for the stakeholders exactly what capabilities you will be deploying as a part of your program. Here are some example Core Capability Statements you might want <span class="No-Break">to use:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Golden Customer Record &amp; <span class="No-Break">Unique ID</span></li>
				<li>Single Source <span class="No-Break">of Truth</span></li>
				<li>Assignment of Unique <span class="No-Break">Customer Identifier</span></li>
				<li>Customer standardization and validations <span class="No-Break">for accuracy</span></li>
				<li>Validated <span class="No-Break">lineage transparency</span></li>
				<li>Customer status (<span class="No-Break">current, former)</span></li>
				<li>Customer Maintenance, Workflow &amp; <span class="No-Break">Stewardship</span></li>
				<li>Customer look up <span class="No-Break">search capability</span></li>
				<li>Add, update, <span class="No-Break">delete customer</span></li>
				<li>3<span class="superscript">rd</span> party <span class="No-Break">data enrichment</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Multi-Hierarchy Management</span></li>
				<li>Search for and classify customer relationship (i.e., <span class="No-Break">customer, partner)</span></li>
				<li>Add, update, <span class="No-Break">delete relationship</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Manage hierarchy</span></li>
				<li>Customer Classification, Segmentation, <span class="No-Break">and Enrichment</span></li>
				<li>3<span class="superscript">rd</span> Party enrichment services (e.g., D&amp;B, <span class="No-Break">Lead Space)</span></li>
				<li>Address <span class="No-Break">enrichment service</span></li>
				<li>Industry vertical assignment, grouping, &amp; <span class="No-Break">classification</span></li>
				<li>Geo, region, and location for sales and <span class="No-Break">support services</span></li>
				<li>Tax ID, GULT, DUNS, <span class="No-Break">NAICS assignment</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-233"><a id="_idTextAnchor232"/>Conceptual Architecture</h2>
			<p>Conceptual architecture <a id="_idIndexMarker667"/>generally defines what the ecosystem surrounding the Primary Data Management environment will look like. This allows you to provide the business and technology stakeholders with a perspective on how the ecosystem will function and interact when PDM <span class="No-Break">is deployed.</span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-234"><a id="_idTextAnchor233"/>Directional Objectives &amp; Specific Measures of Success</h2>
			<p>When <a id="_idIndexMarker668"/>defining the objectives <a id="_idIndexMarker669"/>of the program, for each objective you should define a specific measure and expected outcome to support <span class="No-Break">each objective.</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Increased sales and marketing effectiveness: Targeted sales and marketing campaigns can be created and executed more effectively when contact master data is accurate <span class="No-Break">and up-to-date.</span></li>
				<li>Improved customer service: Customer service representatives can provide better support to customers when they have access to accurate and complete <span class="No-Break">contact information.</span></li>
				<li>Each customer is assigned a unique identifier in the PDM platform, which allows both the customer and the service representative to ensure the correct customer is selected <span class="No-Break">for service.</span></li>
				<li>Reduced<a id="_idIndexMarker670"/> costs: Organizations can save money on marketing costs by eliminating duplicate <a id="_idIndexMarker671"/>contacts and targeting their marketing campaigns to the <span class="No-Break">right audience.</span></li>
				<li>Improved lead conversion to sales. Measure the previous lead conversion before implementing PDM and again after <span class="No-Break">final deployment.</span></li>
				<li>Number of <span class="No-Break">qualified leads.</span></li>
				<li>Number of leads with a valid <span class="No-Break">email address.</span></li>
				<li>Better business decisions: Organizations can make better business decisions by having access to insights into their customer base, such as customer demographics and <span class="No-Break">purchase history.</span></li>
				<li>Each customer record will have valid contact information, verified by a 3<span class="superscript">rd</span> party enrichment service, resulting in an increase in customer data quality (in this example, be sure to baseline the data quality before implementing your PDM platform, and then again at each release to show the <span class="No-Break">measured increase).</span></li>
				<li>Automated customer segmentation to support sales planning process. Measure amount of manual intervention/time spent prior to PDM <span class="No-Break">vs. after.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-235"><a id="_idTextAnchor234"/>Business Benefits of PDM</h2>
			<p>Before we close <a id="_idIndexMarker672"/>out on this topic, I want to leave you with a very specific list of Stakeholders, Business Benefits, and KPIs to use as a starting point for your business case. You should always customize the list for your own company, but I hope you find value in this list as a jumping off point for defining the value of your PDM investment. Because these investments are usually multiple millions of dollars, involve rearchitecting business processes, implementing new <a id="_idIndexMarker673"/>systems, and driving new outcomes, they are hard to sell to the business. But, with clear business benefits, ROI statements, and measures of success (KPIs), I am confident you will be able to launch this capability at <span class="No-Break">your organization.</span></p>

			<p>As you embark <a id="_idIndexMarker674"/>on your PDM journey, I hope that you have gained enough knowledge in this chapter to build a quality business case, explain the value of PDM, understand the types of PDMs, why consumption patterns matter, and how PDM is a great supplemental capability to any CRM. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-236"><a id="_idTextAnchor235"/>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>Deploying PDM is much more than a way to improve the quality of your customer, product, vendor, or employee data, but a way to streamline and drive efficiency and effectiveness across your entire business. PDM is one of the most robust and potentially impactful <a id="_idIndexMarker675"/>capabilities that data governance can deliver for <span class="No-Break">a company.</span></p>
			<p>As we’ve covered in this chapter, there are four key skills that are required to launch a successful PDM capability in <span class="No-Break">your organization:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>The importance of PDM including why it is required for building successful <span class="No-Break">data solutions.</span></li>
				<li>How to design an <span class="No-Break">PDM function.</span></li>
				<li>The specific needs when it comes <span class="No-Break">to implementation.</span></li>
				<li>How to design an <span class="No-Break">PDM solution.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Now that we’ve covered the importance of metadata management (both business and technical) as well as data quality and primary data management, our next topic, data operations, will cover how we operate these capabilities with ease <span class="No-Break">and scale.</span></p>
