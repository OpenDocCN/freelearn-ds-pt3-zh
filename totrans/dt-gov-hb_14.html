			<h1 id="_idParaDest-287"><a id="_idTextAnchor286"/>Data Automation for Impact and More Powerful Results</h1>
			<p>Traditional data governance processes can feel like a program that is separate from the business. With the pace of today’s modern business models, governance must be embedded into the process, and that requires a new way of thinking about data governance. In modern data governance teams, there is a shift away from too much committee work, with more emphasis placed on embedding data governance into processes by design. I refer to this newer model of governance as <strong class="bold">data governance </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">by design</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>This newer way of thinking requires data governance professionals to think and act differently when it comes to governance activities. Data governance by design requires professionals to think about how to embed data governance capabilities into a business process from the start, not alongside it after it has been built. The longer I have spent in the business of data, the more I see the demands of data increasing at a pace that does not have the patience to wait for governance to “happen.” We must evolve now as <span class="No-Break">a profession.</span></p>
			<p>Extracting actionable insights from vast corporate data ecosystems at the speed of business needs also requires a powerful set of tools or data automation capabilities. This chapter dives deep into this transformative set of capabilities, equipping you with the knowledge and understanding to harness the potential of automated data processes. This is a key design component and set of capabilities that support and enable data governance <span class="No-Break">by design.</span></p>
			<p>Imagine a world where data flows seamlessly, users trust the information they receive, and insights emerge effortlessly. Automation is a lever that can be pulled to expedite data governance deliveries. By automating repetitive, manual tasks, we free our teams from the mundane task of data movement and manual manipulation, unlocking time and resources to focus on higher-level analysis and <span class="No-Break">strategic decision-making.</span></p>
			<p>This chapter covers the <span class="No-Break">following topics:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>What <span class="No-Break">is automation?</span></li>
				<li>What is <span class="No-Break">Data automation?</span></li>
				<li>Types of <span class="No-Break">data automation</span></li>
				<li>Benefits of <span class="No-Break">data automation</span></li>
				<li>How to determine which type of automation <span class="No-Break">to use</span></li>

			</ul>
			<p>Before we get into the specifics, let’s ground ourselves in key <span class="No-Break">basic definitions.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-288"><a id="_idTextAnchor287"/>What is automation?</h1>
			<p>Automation broadly <a id="_idIndexMarker821"/>refers to the use of technology to perform tasks with minimal human intervention. It encompasses a wide range of techniques and technologies applied in<a id="_idIndexMarker822"/> various ways. The key aspects of automation include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Reduced human involvement</strong>: The goal is to minimize the need for team members to manually perform tasks, leading to increased efficiency and productivity. A secondary benefit is team member satisfaction, which we will discuss later in <span class="No-Break">this chapter.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Use of technology</strong>: Automation relies on various technologies, from simple tools and scripts to complex artificial intelligence (<span class="No-Break">AI) algorithms.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Pre-defined instructions or processes</strong>: Automated tasks are typically guided by pre-programmed rules, instructions, or decision-making criteria. This could include primary data management algorithms, as defined in <a href="B18846_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor206"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>There are a number of types of automation beyond those covered in this chapter. For the purposes of this book, we will be focusing on data automation capabilities. The capabilities outlined here are specifically selected to enable your data governance capabilities and data governance program, so let’s start to dive deeper by digging into the basics of data automation and how data automation applies to <span class="No-Break">data governance.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-289"><a id="_idTextAnchor288"/>What is data automation?</h1>
			<p>Before we go deep into this topic, we will ground ourselves in a few basics about what data automation is. <strong class="bold">Data automation</strong> is a broad term encompassing various methods for automatically handling data <a id="_idIndexMarker823"/>tasks. Data automation is a specific subset of automation techniques that apply technology to perform data governance with minimal human interaction. This can include a wide range of techniques, from data entry and data cleaning to more complex techniques such as analytics and reporting. We will go into the specific types of data automation in a few pages, but for now, let’s focus on the value and benefits data automation brings to <span class="No-Break">data governance.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-290"><a id="_idTextAnchor289"/>Types of data automation</h2>
			<p>The data automation techniques included in this section should be applied comprehensively across all capabilities outlined in <em class="italic">Part 2</em> of this book. Data automation transforms the way you work <a id="_idIndexMarker824"/>with information and is a complimentary suite of solutions that unlocks additional value in your data capabilities. Consider the contents of this chapter to be additive to what you have learned to <span class="No-Break">this point.</span></p>
			<p>By applying data automation to data governance capabilities, you add exponential benefits and speed to the results and, in essence, you are creating embedded data governance by design into your data governance program, enterprise-wide. We’ll delve into the diverse types of data automation in <span class="No-Break">this section.</span></p>
			<h3>Data integration</h3>
			<p><strong class="bold">Data integration</strong> is the ability to<a id="_idIndexMarker825"/> move data between systems without human intervention (or a significant reduction in human intervention), which breaks down data silos and enables a more seamless analysis experience for users. Data integration <a id="_idIndexMarker826"/>combines data from multiple sources into a unified view. There are typically a series of steps that are involved in integrating data well (known <span class="No-Break">as ETL):</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong class="bold">Extracting data</strong>: Gathering data from one or more sources (e.g., websites, databases, <span class="No-Break">and spreadsheets).</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Transforming data</strong>: This may include cleaning, formatting, or standardizing the data in some way to ensure it is consistent and/or comparable across the various sources that the data was extracted from. You may need to address issues such as formatting, inconsistencies, and null values, and you will need to build processes to resolve <span class="No-Break">conflicting data.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Loading data</strong>: This involves <a id="_idIndexMarker827"/>putting the transformed data into a target source (e.g., a data lake, data warehouse, or other type of source, such <a id="_idIndexMarker828"/>as <span class="No-Break">a report).</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The purpose of data integration is to bring datasets that were previously isolated or trapped in other systems together, sometimes in different formats. These existing data silos make it difficult to analyze the data maintained in various locations (this is sometimes referred to as <strong class="bold">data fragmentation</strong>). By<a id="_idIndexMarker829"/> integrating data into common formats and locations together, this allows companies to do <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Improve <span class="No-Break">data quality</span></li>
				<li>See and leverage deeper insights from larger and more <span class="No-Break">comprehensive datasets</span></li>
				<li>Improve <span class="No-Break">decision making</span></li>
				<li>Increase <span class="No-Break">operational efficiency</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Examples of this include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Providing a centralized data source for <span class="No-Break">business intelligence</span></li>
				<li>Enabling machine learning models by improving accuracy and performance by using a <span class="No-Break">unified dataset</span></li>
				<li>Obtaining a unified view of a customer in a <strong class="bold">customer relationship management</strong> tool (<strong class="bold">CRM</strong>) by integrating <a id="_idIndexMarker830"/>multiple customer <span class="No-Break">data sources</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="callout-heading">Data integration example</p>
			<p class="callout">Instead of manually copying and pasting data from one system to another or spending hours crunching numbers in spreadsheets, data automation empowers you to set up <strong class="bold">ETL processes</strong> that do the heavy lifting for you. These ETL processes follow pre-defined instructions, ensuring<a id="_idIndexMarker831"/> that data flows seamlessly, tasks execute automatically, and insights <span class="No-Break">emerge effortlessly.</span></p>
			<p class="callout">In some CRM environments, you may find up to 80–100 integrations that have been built to enrich the unified view of a customer. When acquisitions occur and customer data is stored in multiple CRMs, integrations can be used to bring customer data together prior to system integration as a temporary solution that enables the business to see all customer information ahead of the hard work of system integration and the decommissioning of <span class="No-Break">legacy systems.</span></p>
			<p>Overall, data integration is an <a id="_idIndexMarker832"/>essential process for organizations that rely on data to make informed decisions, improve operational efficiency, and gain a competitive edge. In today’s economy, it is difficult to find a company that does not rely on data in this way, but in my experience, there are a plethora of opportunities to integrate data better for improved time to insight and <span class="No-Break">improved operations.</span></p>
			<h3>Data transformation</h3>
			<p><strong class="bold">Data transformation</strong> is the process of cleaning, formating, and manipulating data to prepare it for analysis by using a (more) standardized <a id="_idIndexMarker833"/>format for accuracy and usability. Data transformation converts data from one <a id="_idIndexMarker834"/>format or structure into another, which makes it more usable. Data transformation is a key step in data pipeline management and is often a part of data integration work. Data transformation (and integration) work is typically performed by data engineers in service of operations <span class="No-Break">or analytics.</span></p>
			<p>The purpose of data transformation is to convert data or enrich data to make it more useful for a specific purpose or set of purposes. There are many ways to transform data based on the specific need you are working to solve. Examples of this include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data Cleaning</strong>: Removing errors, inconsistencies, <span class="No-Break">and duplicates.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Standardization</strong>: Driving consistency in data (e.g., dates 1/1/2011 to January <span class="No-Break">1, 2011).</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Creating new fields</strong>: Creating derived data by adding or converging data into new fields (<span class="No-Break">e.g., totaling).</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Aggregation</strong>: Summarizing data by grouping it (e.g., average sales per month; total sales <span class="No-Break">per month).</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Filtering</strong>: Extracting subsets of<a id="_idIndexMarker835"/> data based on a range of filters (e.g., current <a id="_idIndexMarker836"/><span class="No-Break">year sales).</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="callout-heading">Data Transformation Example</p>
			<p class="callout">One of the most common types of data transformation is the use of <strong class="bold">primary data management</strong> (<strong class="bold">PDM</strong>) techniques. PDM, as we covered in <a href="B18846_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor206"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></span></a>, is a capability that I have implemented in three different companies. Typically, by bringing together multiple<a id="_idIndexMarker837"/> sources of customer data, I have seen dramatic improvements in data quality, which has a cascading impact on the way in which companies are able to rely on and use customer information to improve revenue, reduce costs, and improve insights. In all cases, the analytics improved as well; however, the main beneficiary was the business. Don’t forget to focus on the impact made outside of your team. In the case of data transformation, the business often benefits the most from the speed and quality of improved <span class="No-Break">data transformation.</span></p>
			<h3>Data analysis and insights</h3>
			<p><strong class="bold">Data analysis and insights</strong>: They represent the ability to automate repetitive analysis tasks, such as generating reports and identifying patterns (e.g., trends), to drive decision-making. Automating these tasks <a id="_idIndexMarker838"/>extracts knowledge and insights from data and saves time and resources in terms of data analysts and data scientists. There are various components to data analysis and insights that <a id="_idIndexMarker839"/>can be automated, including <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Data acquisition and preparation</strong>: This process leverages tooling to automatically extract data from a variety of sources (systems, APIs, and spreadsheets), reducing the manual effort traditionally followed, and this enables error-prone processes to be completed consistently and at scale. This process may also include transformation to automate data cleaning (e.g., correcting the inconsistencies and formatting) to improve the data for <span class="No-Break">further analysis.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Data exploration and analysis</strong>: Tools can identify the patterns and trends in data and any outliers that are normally identified through manual analytics work. This can also benefit data analysts by finding insights that are commonly overlooked or buried deep in the data. The scale of a large organization’s datasets makes it difficult for a human to find trends without using long time frames and expensive tooling. Data automation can enable these processes, where scale is a <span class="No-Break">historical challenge.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Insight generation and communication</strong>: Data automation tools can generate automated reporting and create visualizations (e.g., Tableau dashboards), which present insights in a format that is far easier for end users to explore <span class="No-Break">and review.</span></p>
			<p>The purpose of data analysis and insight data automation is to expedite and drive efficiencies that were once traditionally carried out by high value resources. This process enables data analysis to be completed on higher value work and frees up your data analysts and scientists to perform more <span class="No-Break">high-value tasks.</span></p>
			<p>Examples of this include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Automating reporting and insights so that analysts can focus on interpreting <span class="No-Break">the results</span></li>
				<li>Reducing human errors in data handling so analysts have higher confidence in the reliability of the results, thus improving trust in <span class="No-Break">the data</span></li>
				<li>Enabling the democratization<a id="_idIndexMarker840"/> of data insights so that a wider range of individuals can access and use insights at the speed <span class="No-Break">of business</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Data monitoring and alerting</h3>
			<p><strong class="bold">Data monitoring and alerting</strong> is the process of using technology to continuously observe and analyze data sources, as well as automating the triggering of alerts when specific conditions are met. This<a id="_idIndexMarker841"/> capability enables organizations to identify problems when they occur before they become major problems. <strong class="bold">Monitoring</strong> includes collecting information from sources (e.g., databases, APIs, and network devices) and <a id="_idIndexMarker842"/>using tools to track very specific metrics (e.g., error rates, performance indicators, such as time to process, or specific data quality thresholds, such as percentage completed), as well as analyzing the data in real-time or on a regular candace (i.e., nightly). Another term for<a id="_idIndexMarker843"/> this type of process is <strong class="bold">data observability</strong>. Alerting occurs when a pre-defined threshold is met through monitoring; then, an alert is delivered through an email, SMS, or internal notification (<span class="No-Break">e.g., Slack).</span></p>
			<p>Examples of this include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Server failures</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Security threats</span></li>
				<li>Errors <span class="No-Break">in processing</span></li>
				<li>A sudden drop <span class="No-Break">in orders</span></li>
				<li>Suspicious activities (<span class="No-Break">i.e., fraud)</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Data cleansing</h3>
			<p>Data cleansing, the process of identifying and correcting errors and inconsistencies in data, is a crucial step in ensuring <a id="_idIndexMarker844"/>reliable and trustworthy information for analysis. Fortunately, this<a id="_idIndexMarker845"/> tedious task can be significantly automated, freeing up your valuable time <span class="No-Break">and resources.</span></p>
			<h4>Types of data cleansing automation</h4>
			<p>There are several types of data cleansing automation that represent common techniques to improve the quality of data. There are a few common types that I will provide an overview of here, but please note that each of these types requires its own chapter to get into the technical implementation <a id="_idIndexMarker846"/>details. At a high level, the following are the various types of automation when it comes to <span class="No-Break">data cleaning:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Rule-based automation</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span><ul><li><strong class="bold">Define rules</strong>: Establish clear rules <a id="_idIndexMarker847"/>to identify and address common errors based on data formats, values, <span class="No-Break">and relationships</span></li><li><strong class="bold">Data profiling tools</strong>: Analyze data to identify patterns and define any rules based on <span class="No-Break">these patterns</span></li><li><strong class="bold">Examples of this</strong>: Standardizing date formats, removing outliers, and flagging <span class="No-Break">missing values</span></li></ul></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Fuzzy matching</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span><ul><li><strong class="bold">Identify similar records</strong>: Match records<a id="_idIndexMarker848"/> that have slight variations, such as typos <span class="No-Break">or abbreviations</span></li><li><strong class="bold">Data deduplication</strong>: Eliminate duplicate records based on fuzzy <span class="No-Break">matching algorithms</span></li><li><strong class="bold">Examples of this</strong>: Merging duplicate customer records and identifying inconsistent product names (e.g., <span class="No-Break">PDM capabilities)</span></li></ul></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Some of the benefits of automating cleansing<a id="_idIndexMarker849"/> include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Increased efficiency</strong>: Saving time and resources by automating repetitive <span class="No-Break">cleaning tasks</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Improved accuracy</strong>: Reducing human error and ensuring consistent <span class="No-Break">data quality</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Scalability</strong>: Easily handling large datasets and complex <span class="No-Break">cleaning requirements</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Better insights</strong>: Building more<a id="_idIndexMarker850"/> reliable and trustworthy models based on <span class="No-Break">clean data</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Considerations for the automation of data cleansing</h4>
			<p>Before selecting a type of automated data cleansing for your use case, you should consider the following as you evaluate <span class="No-Break">your </span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker851"/></span><span class="No-Break">options:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data complexity</strong>: Complex data with diverse errors may require manual intervention or <span class="No-Break">advanced algorithms</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Rule development</strong>: Defining effective rules requires understanding your data and <span class="No-Break">common errors</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data security</strong>: Ensure the chosen solutions comply with data security and <span class="No-Break">privacy regulations</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Begin with automating simple cleaning tasks and gradually expand as you gain confidence. By carefully selecting and implementing data cleansing automation, you can unlock the true potential of your data for <span class="No-Break">informed decision-making.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-291"><a id="_idTextAnchor290"/>Advanced data automation capabilities</h2>
			<p>There are several additional advanced capabilities that can be explored beyond the more common data automation <a id="_idIndexMarker852"/>capabilities above. Beyond these core types, the advanced capabilities include the following: data cleansing, machine learning and AI automation, and <strong class="bold">robotic process automation</strong> (<strong class="bold">RPA</strong>). These advanced capabilities <a id="_idIndexMarker853"/>are very helpful for capabilities that are standardized and repeatable. At a high level, there are two capabilities that are especially useful for <span class="No-Break">data automation:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Machine learning and AI automation</strong>: Leverages AI algorithms for deeper analysis, predictions, and data-driven recommendations. Some examples include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span><ul><li><strong class="bold">Training algorithms</strong>: Train models on labeled data to identify and correct errors with greater accuracy <span class="No-Break">and adaptability</span></li><li><strong class="bold">Supervised learning</strong>: Training models on labeled data with correct and <span class="No-Break">incorrect examples</span></li><li><strong class="bold">Unsupervised learning</strong>: Use algorithms to identify anomalies and patterns to suggest <span class="No-Break">potential errors</span></li><li><strong class="bold">Examples of this</strong>: Identifying and correcting spelling errors and predicting missing values based on other <span class="No-Break">data points</span></li></ul></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Robotic Process Automation</strong> (<strong class="bold">RPA</strong>): Automating tasks that interact directly with user interfaces, such as<a id="_idIndexMarker854"/> data entry in <span class="No-Break">web applications.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>These advanced data automation capabilities are much more robust and involved and could warrant an entire book of their own. For now, be aware that these additional types exist; it is often beneficial<a id="_idIndexMarker855"/> to evaluate if they are fit for use in your organization once you have tackled the implementation of the data automation capabilities covered in this chapter. Next, we will dig into the benefits of data automation and how to measure <span class="No-Break">the benefits.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-292"><a id="_idTextAnchor291"/>Benefits of data automation</h1>
			<p>When it comes to automation, the benefits <a id="_idIndexMarker856"/>extend beyond efficiency. Efficiency is a great first principle, but data automation empowers us to do so much more. These benefits can and should be quantified as you build your business case, and as you realize the value, you should report on them to show the return on investment (ROI) for your data automation investments. The common benefits are wide-ranging, such as <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Ensure accuracy and consistency</strong>: Data automation eliminates human error in data handling, leading to reliable and <span class="No-Break">trustworthy information.</span><ul><li><strong class="bold">Example</strong>: Automating the enrichment of data for marketing leads to reduced errors and produces comparable, consistent <span class="No-Break">results daily.</span></li></ul></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Gain deeper insights</strong>: Analyzing vast datasets at scale, uncovering hidden patterns and trends that are invisible to the <span class="No-Break">human eye.</span><ul><li><strong class="bold">Example</strong>: Automatically identifying the hidden patterns between product purchases and customer demographics, such as a situation whereby customers who buy raincoats are also likely to buy umbrellas when weather predicts rain within 48 hours in their location. Thus, the company would benefit from placing umbrellas at the front of the store to encourage a higher <span class="No-Break">purchase rate.</span></li></ul></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Improve decision-making</strong>: Driving data-driven choices by automating data analysis and reporting, providing real-time insights to <span class="No-Break">inform actions.</span><ul><li><strong class="bold">Example</strong>: Data observability built into a data lake to alert when data volumes drop below expectations (e.g., by 5% <span class="No-Break">or greater).</span></li></ul></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Reduce costs</strong>: Streamlining <a id="_idIndexMarker857"/>workflows and optimizing resource allocation, leading to significant <span class="No-Break">cost savings.</span><ul><li><strong class="bold">Example</strong>: Automating the data cleansing of customer records to expedite them leads to account matching in a <span class="No-Break">CRM system.</span></li></ul></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Boost agility</strong>: Respond faster to changing market conditions by automating data collection, analysis, <span class="No-Break">and reporting.</span><ul><li><strong class="bold">Example</strong>: The automation of daily sales reports allows for the additional capacity of data analysts to be focused <span class="No-Break">on anomalies.</span></li></ul></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Improve team member experience</strong>: By automating data processes and basic reporting, team members are able to focus on more interesting and <span class="No-Break">high-value activities.</span><ul><li><strong class="bold">Example</strong>: After automating daily sales reports, data analysts are able to focus on anomaly detection, and they are able to dig into anomalies and uncover additional sales opportunities for specific customer segments, increasing <span class="No-Break">revenue opportunities.</span></li></ul></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Beyond identifying the benefits of data automation, it is critical to measure the impact of the benefits so that you can measure the return on the investment of implementing data automation techniques <a id="_idIndexMarker858"/>within your data governance program. As you work to build out this capability within your data program, ensure you leverage what was learned in <a href="B18846_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor110"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></span></a>. We will build on what was learned in the following section, with a specific tilt towards <span class="No-Break">data automation.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-293"><a id="_idTextAnchor292"/>Measuring the benefits</h2>
			<p>There are a few types of measurement to consider, including both quantitative and qualitative measures. Remember, quantitative measures are based on numbers and are more directly measured, whereas qualitative measures are based on experiences and are harder to measure directly. Both<a id="_idIndexMarker859"/> types of measures are important for your audience to understand, as they benefit your stakeholders in a variety of ways, including their experience of working for <span class="No-Break">your organization.</span></p>
			<h3>Examples of quantitative measures</h3>
			<p>Some examples of quantitative <a id="_idIndexMarker860"/>measures include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Improvement in customer conversion rate</strong>: After implementing data-driven product recommendations <a id="_idIndexMarker861"/>based on next-best-action modeling, track the percentage of customers who make a purchase before and after the implementation of <span class="No-Break">the automation.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Increase in revenue</strong>: Measure sales before and after implementing a data automation capability. Be sure to take into account external factors such as market trends (adjust as needed). Examples of this include personalized marketing campaigns, optimized product placement, or dynamic pricing (e.g., airline <span class="No-Break">ticket pricing).</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Reduction in cost</strong>: Measure the savings of person-hours achieved by automating tasks such as moving data and cleaning data by measuring the number of hours saved multiplied by a base all-in salary rate, including benefits and bonuses. Measure this of a time horizon, such as a week, a month, or a year, less the cost <span class="No-Break">of automation.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Examples of qualitative measures</h3>
			<p>Some examples of qualitative measures<a id="_idIndexMarker862"/> include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Customer satisfaction surveys</strong>: By conducting customer satisfaction surveys, you can identify how effectively data automation capabilities are used to improve the customer experience. An increase in customer satisfaction after the implementation of data automation can indicate improved <span class="No-Break">customer experience.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Employee surveys</strong>: By conducting employee satisfaction surveys for those who benefited from data automation (analysts, business users, and so on) before and after, this can<a id="_idIndexMarker863"/> help identify and assess the impact of data automation on their employee experience. You should expect an increase in job satisfaction when mundane tasks are <span class="No-Break">automated well.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Brand reputation analysis</strong>: By monitoring online reviews and social media, you can determine how brand image is impacted among <span class="No-Break">customer sentiment.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>In Aggregate – Qualitative and quantitative measures</h3>
			<p>When joined together, both qualitative and quantitative measures should enable you to calculate the ROI in data <span class="No-Break">automation </span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker864"/></span><span class="No-Break">activities:</span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Net Benefits / </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Total Costs</strong></span></p>
			<p>Here, net benefits (increased revenue, cost savings, and employee satisfaction improvement) are divided by total costs (investment, time, and so on). This assigns a financial metric to assess the overall benefit of the implementation of data <span class="No-Break">automation capabilities.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">Define the measures in advance of completing the work. This will result in a more objective calculation of the success of the project (in retrospect) than when the calculation of success is determined <span class="No-Break">in hindsight.</span></p>
			<p>By combining quantitative and qualitative data, businesses can gain a comprehensive understanding of the value generated through data automation in this specific example. This multifaceted approach allows for a more holistic evaluation of the impact on both business metrics and <span class="No-Break">customer experience.</span></p>
			<p>In the next section, I will walk you through how to evaluate the data automation types previously explained and define a process that you can use to select the appropriate data automation capability for <span class="No-Break">your needs.</span></p>
			<p>As we explore this determination<a id="_idIndexMarker865"/> process together, you will be equipped with the knowledge to do <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Identify your automation needs</strong>: Assess your current data challenges and determine the most suitable <span class="No-Break">automation solutions</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Select the right tools</strong>: Navigate the diverse landscape of data automation tools and choose the ones that best fit <span class="No-Break">your requirements</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Implement effectively</strong>: Understand the key considerations for successful implementation, ensuring smooth adoption and <span class="No-Break">maximized impact</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>As we walk through this next section, it may be helpful to have a use case in mind so that you can evaluate this process <span class="No-Break">against it.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-294"><a id="_idTextAnchor293"/>How to determine which type of automation to use</h1>
			<p>There is a fairly straightforward process to identify your needs, select the right tools and techniques, and implement them effectively. We will walk through exactly how to determine which type to use and how to execute the process for <span class="No-Break">your company.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-295"><a id="_idTextAnchor294"/>Step 1 – Identify your goals</h2>
			<p>Start by exploring the problem. A few<a id="_idIndexMarker866"/> key questions to ask include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>What are you trying <span class="No-Break">to achieve?</span></li>
				<li>What is working well and needs to <span class="No-Break">be retained?</span></li>
				<li>What are the <span class="No-Break">current challenges?</span></li>
				<li>What outcomes would indicate a <span class="No-Break">successful solution?</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>These exploratory questions can help you determine if you need to increase efficiency, improve data quality, or if you are looking for a deeper result, such as finding deeper insights or meeting regulatory expectations. Perhaps you uncover that you are spending far too much of your team members time on low-value work, such as manual data cleaning, or you are struggling to identify problems proactively. This step will help you identify <span class="No-Break">these goals.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-296"><a id="_idTextAnchor295"/>Step 2 – Identify the existing process and pain points</h2>
			<p>Next, begin to explore the<a id="_idIndexMarker867"/> current state. Ask the following questions of your team and <span class="No-Break">your stakeholders:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>What is the <span class="No-Break">current process?</span></li>
				<li>Have we reviewed the data flow, and are there <span class="No-Break">obvious inefficiencies?</span></li>
				<li>What are the current systems and datasets? (e.g., structured, unstructured, databases, <span class="No-Break">or APIs)</span></li>
				<li>Where in the process are there <span class="No-Break">manual steps?</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Once you have the answers to the current state, you can begin to formulate specific steps to address <span class="No-Break">the problem.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-297"><a id="_idTextAnchor296"/>Step 3 – Agree on the problem statement(s)</h2>
			<p>As you frame the situation in Steps 1 and 2 above, you are ultimately working towards an agreed problem statement (or statements) that define the current state. It’s important to ensure that you <a id="_idIndexMarker868"/>have agreement on what the problem is prior to defining any paths forward for the options in Step 4. Without firmly aligning all parties on the problem, you are much more likely to run into issues when it comes to later steps in the process, especially when affirming the solution when working as it <span class="No-Break">was designed.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-298"><a id="_idTextAnchor297"/>Step 4 – Align on the approach and ROI calculation</h2>
			<p>After (or concurrently) aligning on the problem statement, you should put together at least one (ideally, two or three) option(s) for how you can approach the solution. This alignment may include a <a id="_idIndexMarker869"/>combination of data <a id="_idIndexMarker870"/>automation techniques and may also vary in complexity and the extent of the solution. In the following example, the problem statement comes into play because if the general consensus is that reporting isn’t the issue, it’s unlikely to be supported and receive money to <span class="No-Break">automate it:</span></p>

			<h3>Example menu of data automation capabilities</h3>
			<p>The following list represents a “menu” of data automation capabilities to <span class="No-Break">choose from:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data integration</strong>: Use this if you need to move data between different systems regularly, regardless of the format <span class="No-Break">or source</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data transformation</strong>: Choose this if your data requires cleaning, formatting, or manipulation before being <span class="No-Break">further </span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker871"/></span><span class="No-Break">used</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data loading</strong>: Implement this if you need to automate the final step of depositing transformed data into your <span class="No-Break">target system</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data analysis and insights</strong>: Consider this if you want to automate repetitive analysis tasks and generate insights without <span class="No-Break">manual intervention</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data monitoring and alerting</strong>: Choose this if you need proactive notifications based on specific data conditions to identify and address <span class="No-Break">issues quickly</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Machine learning and AI automation</strong>: Explore this if you want to go beyond simple rules and leverage AI for deeper analysis, predictions, and <span class="No-Break">data-driven recommendations</span></li>

			<h3>Return on investment</h3>
			<p>If you can explain the ROI of the proposals, this adds another layer to the decision-making process. Providing a <a id="_idIndexMarker872"/>proposed ROI for each solution at this stage directly exposes the value of the possible solutions, and this tends to result in a very different outcome than if ROI is strictly calculated upon the completion of the project. In this example, you may want to add an ROI calculation to <span class="No-Break">each row:</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Table 14.2 – Process for calculating the value of an automation project</p>
			<p>This process becomes the expected ROI for the project. You should go into the project with this as a “working assumption.” Upon the completion of Step 6, you will measure the actual results to determine the ROI for the project. Do not let this prevent you from sharing the assumptions with the stakeholders as you enter into the project. Even if you end up materially different than your expectations, this process will build transparency and trust. Your stakeholders may provide valuable input into your ROI modeling by sharing the model with <span class="No-Break">them upfront.</span></p>
			<h3>Additional factors to consider</h3>
			<p>There are a number of factors you could <a id="_idIndexMarker875"/>consider, but the following are typically the most important to evaluate for your particular project <span class="No-Break">or solution:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Available budget</strong>: What financial resources can you afford to spend on <span class="No-Break">this project?</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Resourcing</strong>: Do you have the time and personnel to complete <span class="No-Break">this project?</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Technical expertise</strong>: Do the resources that you have (onboard) also have the technical expertise to complete the work, or do you need to supplement this with <span class="No-Break">outside resources?</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Security or compliance</strong>: Are there specific requirements you need to consider to remain compliant with laws, regulations, or customer <span class="No-Break">contractual obligations?</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Scalability</strong>: If your <a id="_idIndexMarker876"/>company is growing or your data volumes are expected to grow, can the solution handle future projected volumes? Or will you need a new solution down <span class="No-Break">the line?</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In this ROI example, keep in mind that it is typical to combine multiple types of data automation together to optimize the results. If you are considering an example such as the one outlined in the previous part for Step 4, the maximum result will be realized by adopting <span class="No-Break">Approach C.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-299"><a id="_idTextAnchor298"/>Step 5 – Execute</h2>
			<p>While this step in the process often takes the<a id="_idIndexMarker877"/> longest amount of time, it is pretty straightforward. In this step, you execute the option you selected. If you find that you need to adjust your plan as you progress through the project, make adjustments. My advice is to be transparent when you do, with this forming a part of your ongoing messaging and reporting about the project to <span class="No-Break">your stakeholders.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-300"><a id="_idTextAnchor299"/>Step 6 – Measure and report</h2>
			<p>Upon completion, calculate your results based on the model you produced in Step 4. Any deviations (from the expectations) that <a id="_idIndexMarker878"/>require you to reassess or redesign your model are OK; just be clear about why this is and what the impact on your measurement is. The last thing you want is to complete this work only to erode trust by failing to measure and report transparently. Now that you have completed this six-step process, I will explain some additional <a id="_idIndexMarker879"/>options for automation that you can buy and incorporate into your environment versus <span class="No-Break">building them.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-301"><a id="_idTextAnchor300"/>Third-party enrichment</h1>
			<p>One very common type of data enrichment is the use of third-party data enrichment services. Third-party refers to the use of external <a id="_idIndexMarker880"/>data. This type of data is typically purchased from an outside data vendor and added to the data your company creates (referred to as first-party) to create a more enriched and <span class="No-Break">higher-quality dataset.</span></p>
			<p>When you are considering using a third-party data source, consider the following factors. Not all data enrichment is high quality, and using a third-party source that does not meet the expectations of your business can reduce the quality of your data versus improve the quality of <span class="No-Break">your data:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data quality and accuracy</strong>: Ensure the data is reliable and <span class="No-Break">consistently updated</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data coverage and relevance</strong>: Verify the data aligns with your specific needs and <span class="No-Break">target audience</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data privacy and compliance</strong>: Check for compliance with relevant data <span class="No-Break">privacy regulations</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Pricing and cost models</strong>: Understand the pricing structure and choose a solution that fits <span class="No-Break">your budget</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Security and integration</strong>: Ensure secure data access and compatibility with your <span class="No-Break">existing systems</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Remember, it’s often beneficial to evaluate different sources and compare their offerings before committing to one. By carefully evaluating your needs and the available options, you can choose the best third-party data sources to enrich your data for your <span class="No-Break">business needs.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">This is not an endorsement of any of the third parties listed (or not) in the following section; this is simply an example list of the types of third-party enrichment services available that you may have heard of. As with any technology selection process, you should assess the needs of your business and your cost/budget, making a selection based on your <span class="No-Break">company’s process.</span></p>
			<p>The best sources will depend heavily on the needs of your company and the type of data you are working to enhance. I <a id="_idIndexMarker881"/>have provided examples of several types of data to help you understand what types of third-party data enrichment are available, and I provide some examples <span class="No-Break">of each:</span></p>

This list is intended to offer examples and to get you started and is not an endorsement of any particular third-party <span class="No-Break">data solution.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-302"><a id="_idTextAnchor301"/>Data solution examples powered by data automation</h1>
			<p>Now that we have gone through the types of data automation, the benefits of data automation, how to calculate the return on your data automation investment, and what to do to implement it, the hardest remaining<a id="_idIndexMarker883"/> part is identifying where to get started. I recommend you select an area of the business that is exceptionally manual and begin. Yes, just begin. By focusing your efforts on one area, you can show dramatic results. If you spread your data automation efforts across divisions, it may become hard to feel the dramatic improvement that can be realized through data automation capabilities. By focusing your efforts, stakeholders in other divisions will take notice, and you can, over time, move into new parts of <span class="No-Break">the organization.</span></p>
			<p>Here are 10 strategic areas to consider starting with when it comes to designing your data automation capability in <span class="No-Break">your organization:</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-303"><a id="_idTextAnchor302"/>Customer domain</h2>
			<p>First, in the customer domain (every company has customers, so this likely applies to your organization), there are several options for <a id="_idIndexMarker884"/>accelerating your data solutions with automation. Consider the following five <span class="No-Break">common opportunities:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong class="bold">Enhance marketing campaigns</strong>: Automate personalized email marketing, A/B testing, and lead scoring, driving higher engagement <span class="No-Break">and ROI</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Streamline customer onboarding</strong>: Automate data collection, account creation, and initial communication, making the process faster and smoother for <span class="No-Break">new customers</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Personalize customer service</strong>: Utilize chatbots and AI-powered assistants to answer common questions, resolve issues, and enhance the <span class="No-Break">customer experience</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Automate reporting and analytics</strong>: Generate routine reports and dashboards automatically, empowering data-driven decisions <span class="No-Break">across departments</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Accelerate product development</strong>: Automate market research analysis, customer feedback integration, and competitor monitoring, informing efficient product <span class="No-Break">development cycles</span></li>
			</ol>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-304"><a id="_idTextAnchor303"/>Operations domain</h2>
			<p>Like customers, every organization has operations to manage their business. Consider optimizing operations with the <a id="_idIndexMarker885"/>following data automation <span class="No-Break">use cases:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong class="bold">Optimize order processing</strong>: Automate order intake, inventory checks, and shipment management, minimizing errors and improving <span class="No-Break">delivery speed</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Optimize supply chain management</strong>: Automate inventory tracking, supplier communication, and logistics planning, which leads to cost-efficiency and <span class="No-Break">improved responsiveness</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Improve financial management</strong>: Automate invoice processing, expense tracking, and budget monitoring, ensuring accuracy and <span class="No-Break">timely insights</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Boost HR efficiency</strong>: Automate payroll processing, benefit administration, and employee onboarding, freeing up HR resources for <span class="No-Break">higher-level tasks</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Enhance risk management</strong>: Implement automated data security scans, threat detection, and compliance reporting, ensuring a proactive approach <span class="No-Break">to security</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>While these are only a few examples, they are great places to get started in building out your data automation capabilities. As with other capabilities, be sure to build in feedback loops and effective communication patterns for your stakeholders to understand what you are delivering and how to build virtuous cycles of improvement as a standard in your <span class="No-Break">program overall.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-305"><a id="_idTextAnchor304"/>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>Data automation is a specific technique that is additive to the capabilities that are already deployed in your organization. There are several types of data automation that are available to you, and we have covered these. Typically, this capability is a great place for your data engineers and data analytics professionals to drive additional value to your organization. If traditional data governance capabilities are effective at getting from place A to B on a bike, adding data automation capabilities to existing data governance capabilities is like using a car to get from A to B. It will move you faster and with velocity. However, be careful. Moving faster isn’t always the best answer. You must be sure you are automating a strong process; otherwise, you are simply moving problems through your organization faster. As we covered previously, there are several options at your disposal, including using third-party enrichment, implementing additional tooling, such as RPA, and improving data cleansing with services. Consider where automation is beneficial to <span class="No-Break">the business.</span></p>
			<p>As you embark on your data automation journey, remember to do <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Identify the types of automation that would best support <span class="No-Break">data transformation</span></li>
				<li>Identify where to apply automation in terms of data products <span class="No-Break">and solutions</span></li>
				<li>Learn how to obtain support for automation solutions, what types of skills are needed, and how to communicate the results <span class="No-Break">to leadership/sponsors</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Above all else, partner closely with your stakeholders. Focus on aligning expectations and what “good” looks like so that you are tightly aligned on the results that drive tremendous impact and trust in data. Not every single step of every process is a great candidate for automation. As we covered previously, it’s important to evaluate the options and deliberately apply automation where it will drive the most <span class="No-Break">significant ROI.</span></p>
			<p>In the next chapter, I will pivot to the topic of driving the adoption of your solutions. In this chapter, we will carry forward the learnings we have obtained thus far, and we will discuss how to make the solutions “sticky” or more highly adopted within your company. This helps further your ROI by increasing the use of <span class="No-Break">your solutions.</span></p>
