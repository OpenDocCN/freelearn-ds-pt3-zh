			<p>Up to this point in the book, we have focused on data analysis tasks using <strong class="source-inline">pandas</strong>, but there is so much more data science we can do with Python. These next three chapters will serve as an introduction to machine learning in Python with <strong class="source-inline">scikit-learn</strong>—that's not to say that we will be abandoning everything we have worked on so far, though. As we have seen, <strong class="source-inline">pandas</strong> is an essential tool for quickly exploring, cleaning, visualizing, and analyzing data—all of which still need to be done before attempting any machine learning. We won't go into any theory; instead, we will show how machine learning tasks, such as clustering, classification, and regression, can be easily implemented in Python.</p>
