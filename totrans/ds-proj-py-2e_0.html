			<p>If data is the new oil, then machine learning is the drill. As companies gain access to ever-increasing quantities of raw data, the ability to deliver state-of-the-art predictive models that support business decision-making becomes more and more valuable. </p>
			<p>In this book, you'll work on an end-to-end project based around a realistic data set and split up into bite-sized practical exercises. This creates a case-study approach that simulates the working conditions you'll experience in real-world data science projects.  </p>
			<p>You'll learn how to use key Python packages, including pandas, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn, and master the process of data exploration and data processing, before moving on to fitting, evaluating, and tuning algorithms such as regularized logistic regression and random forest. </p>
			<p>Now in its second edition, this book will take you through the end-to-end process of exploring data and delivering machine learning models. Updated for 2021, this edition includes brand new content on XGBoost, SHAP values, algorithmic fairness, and the ethical concerns of deploying a model in the real world. </p>
			<p>By the end of this data science book, you'll have the skills, understanding, and confidence to build your own machine learning models and gain insights from real data. </p>

			<p><em class="italic">Data Science Projects with Python – Second Edition</em> is for anyone who wants to get started with data science and machine learning. If you're keen to advance your career by using data analysis and predictive modeling to generate business insights, then this book is the perfect place to begin. To quickly grasp the concepts covered, it is recommended that you have basic experience with programming in Python or another similar language (R, Matlab, C, etc).  Additionally, knowledge of statistics that would be covered in a basic course, including topics such as probability and linear regression, or a willingness to learn about these on your own while reading this book would be useful.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>Approach</h2>
			<p><em class="italic">Data Science Projects with Python</em> takes a practical case study approach to learning, teaching concepts in the context of a real-world dataset. Clear explanations will deepen your knowledge, while engaging exercises and challenging activities will reinforce it with hands-on practice.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-9"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"/>About the Chapters</h2>
			<p><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em>, <em class="italic">Data Exploration and Cleaning</em>, gets you started with Python and Jupyter notebooks. The chapter then explores the case study dataset and delves into exploratory data analysis, quality assurance, and data cleaning using pandas.</p>
			<p><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em>, <em class="italic">Introduction to Scikit-Learn and Model Evaluation</em>, introduces you to the evaluation metrics for binary classification models. You'll learn how to build and evaluate binary classification models using scikit-learn.</p>
			<p><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em>, <em class="italic">Details of Logistic Regression and Feature Exploration</em>, dives deep into logistic regression and feature exploration. You'll learn how to generate correlation plots of many features and a response variable and interpret logistic regression as a linear model.</p>
			<p><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em>, <em class="italic">The Bias-Variance Trade-Off</em>, explores the foundational machine learning concepts of overfitting, underfitting, and the bias-variance trade-off by examining how the logistic regression model can be extended to address the overfitting problem.</p>
			<p><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em>, <em class="italic">Decision Trees and Random Forests</em>, introduces you to tree-based machine learning models. You'll learn how to train decision trees for machine learning purposes, visualize trained decision trees, and train random forests and visualize the results.</p>
			<p><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em>, <em class="italic">Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and SHAP Values</em>, introduces you to two key concepts: gradient boosting and <strong class="bold">shapley additive explanations</strong> (<strong class="bold">SHAP</strong>). You'll learn to train XGBoost models and understand how SHAP values can be used to provide individualized explanations for model predictions from any dataset.</p>
			<p><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em>, <em class="italic">Test Set Analysis, Financial Insights, and Delivery to the Client</em>, presents several techniques for analyzing a model test set for deriving insights into likely model performance in the future.
