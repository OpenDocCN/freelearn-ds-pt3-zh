- en: Up to this point in the book, we have focused on data analysis tasks using `pandas`,
    but there is so much more data science we can do with Python. These next three
    chapters will serve as an introduction to machine learning in Python with `scikit-learn`—that's
    not to say that we will be abandoning everything we have worked on so far, though.
    As we have seen, `pandas` is an essential tool for quickly exploring, cleaning,
    visualizing, and analyzing data—all of which still need to be done before attempting
    any machine learning. We won't go into any theory; instead, we will show how machine
    learning tasks, such as clustering, classification, and regression, can be easily
    implemented in Python.
