  <div id="sbo-rt-content"><div class="preface" title="Preface"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pref05"/>Preface</h1></div></div></div><p>We are becoming awash in the flood of digital data from scientific research, engineering, economics, politics, journalism, business, and many other domains. As a result, analyzing, visualizing, and harnessing data is the occupation of an increasingly large and diverse set of people. Quantitative skills such as programming, numerical computing, mathematics, statistics, and data mining, which form the core of data science, are more and more appreciated in a seemingly endless plethora of fields.</p><p>My previous book, <span class="emphasis"><em>Learning IPython for Interactive Computing and Data Visualization</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Packt Publishing</em></span>, published in 2013, was a beginner-level introduction to data science and numerical computing with Python. This widely-used programming language is also one of the most popular platforms for these disciplines.</p><p>This book continues that journey by presenting more than 100 advanced recipes for data science and mathematical modeling. These recipes not only cover programming and computing topics such as interactive computing, numerical computing, high-performance computing, parallel computing, and interactive visualization, but also data analysis topics such as statistics, data mining, machine learning, signal processing, and many others.</p><p>All of this book's code has been written in the IPython notebook. IPython is at the heart of the Python data analysis platform. Originally created to enhance the default Python console, IPython is now mostly known for its widely acclaimed notebook. This web-based interactive computational environment combines code, rich text, images, mathematical equations, and plots into a single document. It is an ideal gateway to data analysis and high-performance numerical computing in Python.</p><div class="section" title="What this book is"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book is</h1></div></div></div><p>This cookbook contains in <span class="emphasis"><em>excess</em></span> of a hundred focused recipes, answering specific questions in numerical computing and data analysis with IPython on:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How to explore a public dataset with pandas, PyMC, and SciPy</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How to create interactive plots, widgets, and Graphical User Interfaces in the IPython notebook</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How to create a configurable IPython extension with custom magic commands</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How to distribute asynchronous tasks in parallel with IPython</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How to accelerate code with OpenMP, MPI, Numba, Cython, OpenCL, CUDA, and the Julia programming language</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How to estimate a probability density from a dataset</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How to get started using the R statistical programming language in the notebook</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How to train a classifier or a regressor with scikit-learn</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How to find interesting projections in a high-dimensional dataset</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How to detect faces in an image</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How to simulate a reaction-diffusion system</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How to compute an itinerary in a road network</li></ul></div><p>The choice made in this book was to introduce a wide range of different topics instead of delving into the details of a few methods. The goal is to give you a taste of the incredibly rich capabilities of Python for data science. All methods are applied on diverse real-world examples.</p><p>Every recipe of this book demonstrates not only how to apply a method, but also how and why it works. It is important to understand the mathematical concepts and ideas underlying the methods instead of merely applying them blindly.</p><p>Additionally, each recipe comes with many references for the interested reader who wants to know more. As online references change frequently, they will be kept up to date on the book's website (<a class="ulink" href="http://ipython-books.github.io">http://ipython-books.github.io</a>).</p></div></div></div>

  <div id="sbo-rt-content"><div class="section" title="What you need for this book"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>You need to know the content of this book's prequel, <span class="emphasis"><em>Learning IPython for Interactive Computing and Data Visualization</em></span>: Python programming, the IPython console and notebook, numerical computing with NumPy, basic data analysis with pandas as well as plotting with matplotlib. This book tackles advanced scientific programming topics that require you to be familiar with the scientific Python ecosystem.</p><p>In Part 2, you need to know the basics of calculus, linear algebra, and probability theory. These chapters introduce different topics in data science and applied mathematics (statistics, machine learning, numerical optimization, signal processing, dynamical systems, graph theory, and others). You will understand these recipes better if you know fundamental concepts such as real-valued functions, integrals, matrices, vector spaces, probabilities, and so on.</p><div class="section" title="Installing Python"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl2sec05"/>Installing Python</h2></div></div></div><p>There are many ways to install Python. We highly recommend the free Anaconda distribution (<a class="ulink" href="http://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/">http://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/</a>). This Python distribution contains most of the packages that we will be using in this book. It also includes a powerful packaging system named conda. The book's website contains all the instructions to install Anaconda and run the code examples. You should learn how to install packages (<code class="literal">conda install packagename</code>) and how to create multiple Python environments with conda.</p><p>The code of this book has been written for Python 3 (more precisely, the code has been tested on Python 3.4.1, Anaconda 2.0.1, Windows 8.1 64-bit, although it definitely works on Linux and Mac OS X), but it also works with Python 2.7. We mention any compatibility issue when required. These issues are rare in this book, because NumPy does the heavy lifting in most cases. NumPy's interface hasn't changed between Python 2 and Python 3.</p><p>If you're unsure about which Python version you should use, pick Python 3. You should only pick Python 2 if you really need to (for example, if you absolutely need a Python package that doesn't support Python 3, or if part of your user base is stuck with Python 2). We cover this question in greater detail in <a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Best Practices in Interactive Computing">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Best Practices in Interactive Computing</em></span>.</p><p>With Anaconda, you can install Python 2 and Python 3 side-by-side using conda environments. This is how you can easily run the couple of recipes in this book that require Python 2.</p></div><div class="section" title="GitHub repositories"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl2sec06"/>GitHub repositories</h2></div></div></div><p>A home page and two GitHub repositories accompany this book:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The main webpage at <a class="ulink" href="http://ipython-books.github.io">http://ipython-books.github.io</a></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The main GitHub repository, with the codes and references of all recipes, at <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/ipython-books/cookbook-code">https://github.com/ipython-books/cookbook-code</a></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Datasets used in certain recipes at <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/ipython-books/cookbook-data">https://github.com/ipython-books/cookbook-data</a></li></ul></div><p>The main GitHub repository is where you can:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Find all code examples as IPython notebooks</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Find all up-to-date references</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Find up-to-date installation instructions</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Report errata, inaccuracies, or mistakes via the issue tracker</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Propose fixes via Pull Requests</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Add notes, comments, or further references via Pull Requests</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Add new recipes via Pull Requests</li></ul></div><p>The online list of references is a particularly important resource.
