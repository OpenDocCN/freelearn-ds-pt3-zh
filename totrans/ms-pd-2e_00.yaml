- en: pandas is a popular Python library used by data scientists and analysts worldwide
    to manipulate and analyze their data. This book presents useful data manipulation
    techniques in pandas for performing complex data analysis in various domains.
    It provides features and capabilities that make data analysis much easier and
    faster than with many other popular languages, such as Java, C, C++, and Ruby.
