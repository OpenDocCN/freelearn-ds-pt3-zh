			<h1 id="_idParaDest-251"><a id="_idTextAnchor250"/>Launch Powerfully</h1>
			<p>Any good data governance program can quickly lose impact if not launched properly. Even with a clear purpose, milestones, and great execution, the approach to launch will determine the success (or failure) of the program. The importance of the launch cannot be underscored enough. As we embark on <em class="italic">Part 3</em> of this book, we will walk through how to create simple and strong core messaging to engage and clearly articulate to the stakeholder community what and how the delivery will be accomplished. Then, I will lead you through the creation of a launch plan, a design of feedback loops to ensure continuous improvement, and finally, how to report on an ongoing basis <span class="No-Break">for impact.</span></p>
			<p>The next five chapters, which together make up <em class="italic">Part 3</em> of this book, take all the knowledge from the last 11 chapters and guide you through translating the information into a true data governance transformation. Be mindful that understanding the capabilities outlined to this point in this book is one thing, but turning the information into a successful data governance transformational program is another. Some of the best technical data governance leaders struggle with this translation into impact, because “being technical” is not enough. It is the basic requirement to be a data expert. However, without the ability to bring others along the journey with you, and translate it into impactful business outcomes, you will not <span class="No-Break">be successful.</span></p>
			<p>As you embark on your journey to launch a data governance transformation, it’s so important that you get the early launch plan right. The focus of this chapter will walk you through this critical step. As a data leader, or a business leader, or if you are sponsoring a data leader, it’s your job to ensure that the business deeply understands, is bought into, and will stand behind the data transformation for the duration of the program. Given that most data governance transformations take anywhere between 24 and 36 months, getting the entirety of the company to stand behind you for the long haul is of utmost importance. Some key capabilities, such as the primary data of management, data operations, and target architecture, will take far longer to deliver on the return on investment than others. Therefore, it is important to launch powerfully, which includes delivering quick wins (which we will dig into in <a href="B18846_13.xhtml#_idTextAnchor264"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 13</em></span></a><span class="No-Break">).</span></p>
			<p>The data leader, along with their executive sponsor, should craft a prolific future state vision that allows the company to visualize what the future will be like once a data governance transformation has been completed. As a data professional, you know that data work is never done. Much like getting into shape after a long period without exercise, there is a hill to climb. However, once you’ve climbed the hill, you can’t stop exercising. No, you must keep exercising to maintain your level <span class="No-Break">of fitness.</span></p>
			<p>The same is true for data. You will need to deliver on a transformation (or implementation) to drive the capabilities outlined in <em class="italic">Chapters 6</em> to <em class="italic">11</em> into your company’s DNA. Not just once, but in a sustainable way. This is the “getting into shape” part of the program. Beyond the transformation, you will maintain the company’s level of “data fitness” through ongoing data practice, much like you would maintain a level of physical fitness. Your company should not be the same after you deliver <span class="No-Break">your transformation.</span></p>
			<p>We will cover the following main topics in <span class="No-Break">this chapter:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Assessing readiness <span class="No-Break">for launch</span></li>
				<li>Simple and strong <span class="No-Break">core messaging</span></li>
				<li>Executing a comprehensive communication strategy for data <span class="No-Break">strategy deployment</span></li>
				<li>Designing <span class="No-Break">feedback loops</span></li>
				<li>Setting and meeting expectations for <span class="No-Break">program launch</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-252"><a id="_idTextAnchor251"/>Assessing readiness for launch</h1>
			<p>Before you<a id="_idIndexMarker721"/> prepare to launch, you need to pause and assess the current state. No, I don’t mean from a data management maturity perspective, but the business readiness. If you head into your launch plan assuming that the business is more ready to change than you assessed it to be, you will face resistance and will be frustrated early. If you underappreciate the readiness, you might find yourself selling it on a transformation it is already bought into. This can be equally as bad. If the business isn’t ready, you might be pushing for change they don’t think they need. If it is beyond ready, you’ll be talking about change when they are already wanting to see the change happening. You lose credibility and support in both scenarios. That’s why assessing the readiness is <span class="No-Break">so important.</span></p>
			<p>The degree <a id="_idIndexMarker722"/>to what you need to assess has several factors <span class="No-Break">to consider:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Do you have an established <span class="No-Break">data function?</span></li>
				<li>How trusted is your data by all levels of <span class="No-Break">the company?</span></li>
				<li>Do you have core capabilities <span class="No-Break">in production?</span></li>
				<li>What is your maturity score, and is it accurately reflecting your company’s state of <span class="No-Break">data maturity?</span></li>
				<li>Do you have an identified data leader? Are they positioned appropriately and supported to deliver a <span class="No-Break">large-scale transformation?</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-253"><a id="_idTextAnchor252"/>Performing the assessment</h2>
			<p>To help <a id="_idIndexMarker723"/>you assess how ready your organization is for a data governance transformation, let’s spend a moment reflecting upon the state of your<a id="_idIndexMarker724"/> organization. Plot the answers to the preceding questions here, so you can come back to reference them as we work through this chapter together on the following charts. The answers to these five questions do not necessarily mean your company is not ready—they are simply indicators as to the approach you need to take as you prepare to <span class="No-Break">launch powerfully.</span></p>
			<h3>Established data function</h3>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker725"/>first factor—the existence and maturity of your data function—is a consideration but any answer is not a deal breaker. If you have an established data function, it is a consideration but having one isn’t a barrier to get started. You can use the lack of a central function to drive investment in one, or to drive centralization if needed. If there is a central function already in place, you may be able to move faster to drive transformation. Therefore, when it comes to establishing your transformational program, having the team in place will help you to get down the path of <span class="No-Break">transformation faster.</span></p>

				</div>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.1 – Established data function</p>
			<h3>Highly trusted data</h3>
			<p>No one <a id="_idIndexMarker726"/>will argue with you, but having trusted data is no longer a <em class="italic">nice to have</em> but a requirement for any company. When you have high trust in data, it is a signal that the executive team not only relies on data for business decisions but also believes that the data they used to make those decisions is reliable. Not having trust in data shows up in a number of ways, including inconsistent information at the executive level, questions about the validity of the information, a clear lack of capabilities, data, and data quality, and ultimately, low trust in the <span class="No-Break">data function.</span></p>
			<p>When trust is low, painting a picture of a world where trust in data is not the exception but the norm can be very compelling. A great and simple use case is to ask your executive team which metrics (KPIs or OKRs) they use to measure the success of the company. Then ask how confident they are in the numbers. Is the executive team aligned that these metrics are correct and reliable? Do you <span class="No-Break">trust them?</span></p>
			<p>Most companies will tell you that they do not have alignment in the most critical metrics. Or, they will say they are confident in the number their team is responsible for but not others. This signals a low trust in data and can be a great use case to <span class="No-Break">start with.</span></p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.2 – Trust in data</p>
			<h3>Established capabilities</h3>
			<p>The next <a id="_idIndexMarker727"/>factor to consider as you are assessing the state of established capabilities is the fitness of your established capabilities in place prior to launching a data transformation. Prior to launch, assess the state of established data governance capabilities. Regardless of centralization, does your organization<a id="_idIndexMarker728"/> have councils, stewardship in place, Meta, date of management, capabilities, data, quality, primary data of management, or data operations? If yes, to what extent are these capabilities mature and available for use across the organization? Are they highly adopted? If yes, then you have a leg up on launching your program. Simply having these capabilities gets you off to a strong start in transforming the way in which they are utilized in support of strong <span class="No-Break">data enablement.</span></p>
			<p>However, not having established data management capabilities does not prevent you from launching a program. It’s simply means that you need to build the capabilities as you transform the organization at large. As with the preceding factors, neither strong nor weak data governance capabilities will prevent you from launching powerfully; it is simply something to be aware of as you determine the degree of transformation that is required for <span class="No-Break">your company.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer072" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18846_12_3.jpg" alt="Figure 12.3 – Core capabilities"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.3 – Core capabilities</p>
			<h3>Data management maturity</h3>
			<p>As we <a id="_idIndexMarker729"/>discussed in <a href="B18846_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor087"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>, you should use your data management maturity scores to bring awareness of the state of data governance at your company. A lower data management maturity score can help drive transparency and awareness to your executives regarding the true, unbiased state of data capabilities. This is a purer measure of the state of your organization versus simply assessing the existence of capabilities and the previous factor because data management maturity takes into consideration how embedded these capabilities are in <span class="No-Break">day-to-day operations.</span></p>
			<p>If you have a high data management maturity score, meaning a level of 4 or 5, it is unlikely that you need to do a significant data management transformation enterprise-wide. It may mean that you have focused pockets of improvement to deliver. Most companies remain somewhere between a 3 and a 3.5 on the data management maturity scale, although it varies based on industry. Financial services and healthcare, for example, tend<a id="_idIndexMarker730"/> to be more mature than other industries. The reason for this is the more intensive regulation around the control and protection <span class="No-Break">of data.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer073" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18846_12_4.jpg" alt="Figure 12.4 – Data management maturity"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.4 – Data management maturity</p>
			<h3>Strong leadership</h3>
			<p>Finally, assess <a id="_idIndexMarker731"/>the state of your data leadership. Do you have a chief data and analytics officer? Do you have an executive sponsor? Do you have a path to secure ongoing funding? Do you have the support of your C-suite? If you do not have these things, gathering support to drive a data transformation will be very difficult. You may need to select a smaller program or project to focus on to drive credibility and visibility at the most senior levels of your organization as a first step. However, if you are fortunate enough to have senior leaders supporting you with funding in place or the opportunity to secure funding for a data transformation, then you are in a great position to launch a powerful data management transformation for your company. Most chief data and analytics officers would greatly desire to have this kind <span class="No-Break">of support.</span></p>
			<p>If you do not have executive support, there is one thing you can do to start to gain it. That is to socialize your vision (which we will cover here in a moment) and your corresponding plan. By going through the state of the union and helping to educate your executives one by one, you will help to open their eyes as to what the company is experiencing today because it is <span class="No-Break">not mature.</span></p>
			<p>My suspicion, having led this type of effort many times over, is that simply educating your executives and helping them see the truth about the state of the union will help you gain support. It may take time, but one by one, these conversations will help you build awareness that you need to <span class="No-Break">launch powerfully.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer074" class="IMG---Figure">

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.5 – Data leadership</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-254"><a id="_idTextAnchor253"/>Common baseline</h2>
			<p>Most companies<a id="_idIndexMarker732"/> start their data journey with something <span class="No-Break">like this:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Some data teams scattered throughout the company (some may be more mature than others, but <span class="No-Break">no consistency)</span></li>
				<li>Some trust in information, usually more in finance, due to financial regulations supporting regulatory and <span class="No-Break">financial reporting</span></li>
				<li>Some capabilities, usually more manual; low <span class="No-Break">consistency enterprise-wide</span></li>
				<li>Resulting data maturity isn’t zero, but it’s on the lower side due to the inconsistency and fragmentation <span class="No-Break">of efforts</span></li>
				<li>There is a data leader appointed (usually one of the reasons a data transformation is possible, as they will champion it), but staffing and formalization <span class="No-Break">are needed</span><p class="list-inset">Together, this becomes a snapshot view of your “As-Is” state of the union. The plot lines for the exercise may look <span class="No-Break">like this:</span></p></li>
			</ul>
			<div>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.6 – As-Is example</p>
			<p>Now, you are <a id="_idIndexMarker733"/>ready to get started in crafting your messaging. These five assessment criteria will inform <em class="italic">how</em> you message the transformation, so that you can <span class="No-Break">launch powerfully.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-255"><a id="_idTextAnchor254"/>Simple and strong core messaging</h1>
			<p>As you embark <a id="_idIndexMarker734"/>on a formal data governance transformation, it is of utmost importance that you make your messaging simple and understandable to the masses. One great way to do this is to think about what life will be like once you’ve delivered. A great way to do this is to start by outlining your <em class="italic">as is</em> versus your <em class="italic">to be</em> state. I’ve seen this work well in a number of companies and as a clear way to depict the variance between before and after. This should be done in several ways, but first and foremost, it should be done from a <span class="No-Break">business perspective.</span></p>
			<p>For example, if it takes 18 days to complete a quote for a customer in the current state but, in the future state, we expect it to only take 8 hours, you should define this for the user. Show them and tell them <em class="italic">how</em> you’re going to <span class="No-Break">get there:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Are you going to implement a <span class="No-Break">new system?</span></li>
				<li>Are you going to <span class="No-Break">automate processes?</span></li>
				<li>Are you going to remove <span class="No-Break">redundant processes?</span></li>
				<li>Are you going to create <span class="No-Break">new models?</span></li>
				<li>Maybe it’s even a combination of all of <span class="No-Break">the above</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Ultimately, the<a id="_idIndexMarker735"/> more you can define the experience that <em class="italic">will be</em> compared to the experience <em class="italic">that is</em>, the better chances you will have to gain business support and be able to launch your transformation <span class="No-Break">program powerfully.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-256"><a id="_idTextAnchor255"/>Crafting a compelling vision</h2>
			<p>Before <a id="_idIndexMarker736"/>you start to socialize the broader plan to transform the company’s use of data, you need to take the time to create a compelling view of the future. This is the time to craft an imagined future for your company. What will the company be like? How will it operate? What will the lived experience for employees, customers, and stakeholders be? What will they be able to do in that future state that they can’t do today? What won’t they have <span class="No-Break">to do?</span></p>
			<p>This is much more art than science in that it is your opportunity to really dream about the future state you and your team will create. It’s the time to let the technical components sit aside and tap into the emotional parts of data. How will that future <span class="No-Break">state feel?</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Example</p>
			<p class="callout">One of my very favorite data transformations began as a side project. There was a difficult reporting process that required consistency and primary data to allow for some of the most complicated regulatory reporting to occur. We started out by finding a couple of really good examples of what it took in the present state to complete this regulatory required reporting process. By fully understanding the efforts that it took to do large scale enterprise reporting, we were able to identify that there were hundreds of people manually touching the data in order to create a single report. A large amount of the manual intervention was in rationalizing data across systems that didn’t align systematically. It required <span class="No-Break">manual intervention.</span></p>
			<p class="callout">We were able to craft a powerful vision that gave the company clarity around what a future state could be if we implemented common reference data and published the reference data for all systems to consume. Aligning the company to these common reference status sets enabled the inconsistencies to be remediated. It allowed for a dramatically simplified and much more automated process to support this data aggregation work across the organization at large. By showing this use case across the company to several executives, including the chief financial officer, the chief risk officer, and the chief data officer, we were able to get there <span class="No-Break">rather easily.</span></p>
			<p class="callout">The hardest part was making the story so crystal clear that anyone who heard it would understand and immediately support it moving forward. This is the way to launch powerfully. Bring clarity to your baseline so that everyone has a common understanding and will support you moving forward. In this example, the hardest decision became where the funding was going to come from—not whether we were going to get funding but where from. With three C-Suite executives supporting us, it was a <span class="No-Break">big win.</span></p>
			<p>Remember, the<a id="_idIndexMarker737"/> vision statement is intended to be a lofty long-term view. It is meant to be inspiring and high-level. A few <span class="No-Break">examples follow:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Harmoniously orchestrate our disparate data sources, transforming siloed whispers into a powerful chorus of actionable insights, propelling us toward data-driven decisions at <span class="No-Break">every level.</span></li>
				<li>Empower every employee with self-service access to curated, trustworthy data, igniting a culture of data-driven problem-solving and innovation across the <span class="No-Break">entire organization.</span></li>
				<li>Leverage AI and predictive analytics to shift from reacting to trends to predicting them, anticipating market shifts, optimizing resource allocation, and navigating business landscapes <span class="No-Break">with confidence.</span></li>
				<li>Transform operational data into a potent elixir of efficiency, streamlining processes, reducing waste, and maximizing ROI through automated workflows and <span class="No-Break">real-time insights.</span></li>
				<li>Break down barriers between departments, democratize access to data, foster cross-functional collaboration, and harness collective intelligence for <span class="No-Break">game-changing outcomes.</span></li>
				<li>Craft a personalized journey for every customer, weaving data-driven insights into every touchpoint, exceeding expectations and building <span class="No-Break">lasting loyalty.</span></li>
				<li>Mine<a id="_idIndexMarker738"/> the wisdom hidden within historical data to anticipate and mitigate potential risks, building a resilient and agile organization prepared for <span class="No-Break">any challenge.</span></li>
				<li>Guide our environmental and social impact with purpose, using data to optimize resource consumption, minimize waste, and drive responsible growth for a <span class="No-Break">sustainable future.</span></li>
				<li>Transform data into a strategic weapon, uncovering market opportunities, outmaneuvering rivals, and establishing a dominant position in an <span class="No-Break">ever-evolving marketplace.</span></li>
				<li>Empower a data-driven culture, where every decision is informed by insights, every employee champions data literacy, and data fuels our relentless pursuit <span class="No-Break">of excellence.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-257"><a id="_idTextAnchor256"/>As Is versus To Be (aka current versus future state)</h2>
			<p>As you <a id="_idIndexMarker739"/>bring the vision to life, the As Is versus To Be state <a id="_idIndexMarker740"/>will bring that vision to a more grounded future state. Creating a specific and distilled view of what the difference is between the current state and the future state is a critical next step in clearly communicating the reason why change <a id="_idIndexMarker741"/>is needed. Crystalizing the future opportunity into a simple story that can describe the future, further building on the compelling vision you have defined, helps fuel the motivation that is required to bring your company along on the journey to transform. This will help build understanding and also serve as a backdrop for everything that you will do to drive to the <span class="No-Break">imagined future.</span></p>
			<p>By effectively defining this As Is versus To Be state view, you will be bringing to life the vision created. This will help further define exactly what is working as well. Maybe there are some components that are working well that you can acknowledge and highlight. This will make your imagined future credible and believable. One risk, especially if you are new to the organization, is that stakeholders assume (perhaps incorrectly) that you haven’t taken enough time to understand the specific nuances of the company. By being specific in your As Is state, you will be able to further gain credibility by acknowledging what works well <a id="_idIndexMarker742"/>today that can be <span class="No-Break">built on.</span></p>
			<p>I recommend you start with two one-page views of the As-Is versus <span class="No-Break">To-Be view:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Describe succinctly what the current state is in a few bullets (e.g., it takes days to weeks for analysts to find the data they need to create insights) versus the future state (e.g., analysts will be able to find certified data sets in an enterprise data catalog, enabling insights to be produced in hours <span class="No-Break">versus months)</span></li>
				<li>Visually depict what this will look like (e.g., a marketecture view) to help <em class="italic">show</em> rather than <em class="italic">tell</em> what the future will <span class="No-Break">look like:</span></li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer076" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.7 – As is versus To be concept</p>
			<p>By leveraging <a id="_idIndexMarker743"/>both a succinct bullet approach for one page and a visual depiction for the second page, you cover your bases for visual versus verbal learners. If you are challenged to write it this crisply, start with a longer view and work toward a concise story. Ultimately, if you can’t describe it this succinctly, you may struggle to get buy in. Most executives need a clear path to the outcome, and by keeping your future state crisp, your executive team will understand why this matters quickly. If you can’t describe the outcome briefly, you may not be ready to drive <span class="No-Break">the future.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer077" class="IMG---Figure">

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.8 – As is versus To be marketecture</p>
			<p>To get to this target <a id="_idIndexMarker744"/>state and to outline the appropriate To Be state for your organization, you will need to leverage the work outlined in <em class="italic">Chapters 1</em> to <em class="italic">5</em>. You will also need to have a good understanding of the company’s current state and a clear understanding of what needs to happen in order to define this view appropriately. This is one of the hardest steps in preparing to launch your transformation—to translate the needs of your company into the transformation that is needed. It will be unique to your particular situation and company. It will help to gather input from stakeholders, executives, and best practices from other companies, but ultimately, your strategy is for <span class="No-Break">your company.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-258"><a id="_idTextAnchor257"/>Getting crisp with your messaging</h2>
			<p>As you prepare to <a id="_idIndexMarker745"/>launch your strategy, you will need to take the work from <em class="italic">Chapters 1</em> to <em class="italic">5</em> distilled into a strategy and craft it into a crisp message that will resonate with your stakeholders. You should expect that different stakeholders will want different levels of detail. The first step in defining great messaging for launch is to determine which audiences you will need to message to, and what kinds of information they <span class="No-Break">will need:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Individual Contributors/Front Line Managers</strong>: Will need detailed information such as project plans and specific tasks assigned <span class="No-Break">to individuals</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Middle and Upper Management</strong>: Will need a more aggregated and strategic view, as well as key milestones and <span class="No-Break">aligned outcomes</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">C-Suite and Board of Directors</strong>: Will need a highly summarized outcome-oriented plan showing what the company will achieve or experience as a result of <span class="No-Break">this work</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>To meet the needs of these various audiences, you will need to write a few different types of strategic messaging material. However, one of the best recommendations I can offer, is to start with a <em class="italic">North Star</em> or strategic memo. This memo can not only serve as the backdrop for all that you will do but also shows any audience that you have a well-thought-out plan. I recommend you aim to keep this memo under 10 pages. It will force you to go into enough detail to explain what you will deliver, why, and how you will measure success without becoming <span class="No-Break">overly verbose.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-259"><a id="_idTextAnchor258"/>Writing a narrative memo</h2>
			<p>As <a id="_idIndexMarker746"/>mentioned, one of the best ways to crystalize your strategy is to simply write it. It sounds obvious, but many executives fail to move from pictures into a full description of the strategy. A memo is great for two reasons: it helps you fully crystalize your strategy and it defines the future state in a very specific way. It forces you to think through the details and refine the messaging clearly. In a picture or a slide, you have more liberty to skirt the details, whereas in a narrative, you are forced to be more thoughtful <span class="No-Break">and specific.</span></p>
			<p>Within the<a id="_idIndexMarker747"/> North Star strategy, you should cover three key areas: why there is a need to change, what will be changed, and how the company will get there. I recommend that you really take the opportunity to think through this as it will set the tone for the next few years of work; however, you should set an expectation that the document is living and will be updated regularly (at least annually) to ensure it continues to enable the <span class="No-Break">company’s strategy.</span></p>

			<p>As you draft out the strategy memo for your company, iterate. Ask for feedback while you are drafting. I recommend identifying a few key supportive executives to contribute to the memo. This <a id="_idIndexMarker748"/>tip will enable you to enter into your strategy launch in partnership with your stakeholders instead of singularly attempting to change the company. You now have partners in the mission by bringing them into the drafting <span class="No-Break">with you.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-260"><a id="_idTextAnchor259"/>Design based on outcomes</h2>
			<p>A good <a id="_idIndexMarker749"/>business project starts with the end in mind. This means fast-forwarding in time and really thinking about what life will be like once you deliver on your program. You must start with your company’s strategy, and the divisional strategies focused on delivering against the company’s strategy. Your work must support and enable the strategy. Spend time outlining specifically what the company is aiming to deliver, and how your work supports that at a granular level. Is the company focusing on the operating margin? Show how your team’s work is creating margin through cost savings activities. Be clear about <em class="italic">how</em>. Some key areas you may focus on are <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Driving product innovation <span class="No-Break">or efficiency</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Increasing revenue</span></li>
				<li>Improving operational efficiency and/or <span class="No-Break">reducing expenses</span></li>
				<li>Measurable improvement in customer satisfaction <span class="No-Break">or experience</span></li>
				<li>Reducing risk to <span class="No-Break">the business</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>By framing the work in your transformation into these categories and translating this into your North Star, you will help the business understand why what your team delivers is important to them and, therefore, <span class="No-Break">their success.</span></p>
			<p>One of the biggest risks for failure is to invest in programs or capabilities that do not clearly link to business outcomes. If the business does not clearly understand why the work you are leading for the company translates into impact for them, they won’t support you. Furthermore, they could argue against you. Time, money, and resources are all finite. If you can’t clearly articulate what you are doing in terms that impact their ability to be successful, you won’t <span class="No-Break">be successful.</span></p>
			<p>It is easy to over rotate on operational efficiency and risk mitigation. These are important parts of your duty to the company. However, the more you can translate the work of the data office to revenue, the more successful you will be. At times, this will be a few steps<a id="_idIndexMarker750"/> removed, and that is okay. However, do not make the mistake of failing to connect to revenue, even if a <span class="No-Break">step removed.</span></p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-261"><a id="_idTextAnchor260"/>Creating a repeatable process</h1>
			<p>As you prepare<a id="_idIndexMarker751"/> your launch plan, ensure you are prepared to educate wide and deep into the organization. You should plan to go on a roadshow-type communication tour, sharing the vision, the plan, and what the future will be. Tell them, tell them what you told them, then tell them again. You will need to leverage several types of communication mechanisms to ensure you have <span class="No-Break">enterprise-wide understanding:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Memo</strong>: Ensure your data strategy memo is published and available for review broadly. Transparency is a big benefit to <span class="No-Break">launching powerfully.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Plan</strong>: Build a plan to show what you will deliver and when. Be specific about what the stakeholders will be able to do at each release or publication, so they can digest what they can expect along the way (not just at <span class="No-Break">the end).</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Updates</strong>: Plan out how you will update your stakeholder communities along the journey. You will need different updates for the board versus individuals directly working on the data strategy. Define what they will be upfront so that you can tell your stakeholders what they can expect <span class="No-Break">from you.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Status reports</strong>: Define what status reports will need to look like. Define how you will share them. Consider live verbal updates versus written async updates, based on your company’s culture and preference. Do not shy away from making these open to a broad audience. Transparency builds trust (especially when it’s <em class="italic">not</em> good news). If your stakeholders know they can trust you to share hard news, they will know they can trust the positive <span class="No-Break">news too.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Budgets</strong>: Although<a id="_idIndexMarker752"/> not relevant for all audiences, you should have a detailed budget that you use to measure financial aspects of your data <span class="No-Break">strategy deployment.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">KPIs and success measures</strong>: Define how you will measure success. A best practice is to publish a scorecard that can show progress over time. Define what the measures are, and how they are calculated. Again, transparency is key, since you will be publishing your own metrics <span class="No-Break">of success.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Remember, the entire data team and sponsors are all evangelists for the data strategy and corresponding implementation plan. Bring positive energy to every forum. When you are excited about the strategy and future of the company’s use of data, others will <span class="No-Break">be too.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-262"><a id="_idTextAnchor261"/>Designing feedback loops</h1>
			<p>As<a id="_idIndexMarker753"/> you launch (not after), define how you will improve along your journey. You will only get better at delivering great outcomes if you establish routes for continuous improvement, and that includes a focus on feedback loops. As you launch, you should explain to all stakeholders (executives, managers, and individual contributors) how they can provide input, and encourage them to do so. If they see something that can be better, encourage them to <span class="No-Break">say something.</span></p>
			<p>You may want to establish a few options <span class="No-Break">for this:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Verbal feedback through forums</strong>: Stand up forums for individuals to learn about the delivery of your strategy. You may need a few different forums for various audiences. Leverage your Enterprise Data Governance Council or committee to provide updates to your executive stakeholders. You may also want to stand up a broader townhall-style forum to distribute verbal updates to <span class="No-Break">larger audiences.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Formal feedback through surveys</strong>: Periodically throughout your data strategy implementation, you may want to request formal feedback. A great way to do this for a wide audience is through the use of surveys. If you are going to request written feedback from a wide audience, you should define what you are going to do with the feedback. I recommend committing to share the feedback, good or bad, to <span class="No-Break">your stakeholders.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Written feedback through workflows</strong>: If your organization uses a workflow tool, you may opt to allow feedback to be continuously submitted for consideration<a id="_idIndexMarker754"/> by the data team. This allows freer flowing information during the implementation but requires your team to manage the workflow. Depending on the degree of change, you may consider this option for larger transformations that are moving quickly so you can <span class="No-Break">adjust quickly.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>As you work together with your stakeholders to share updates, listen for input, and adapt accordingly, you will ensure the stakeholders continue to gain value from the transformation that you are delivering through implementing your data strategy. By failing to create feedback loops and incorporate appropriate feedback as you deliver your strategy, you risk delivering outcomes that do not serve <span class="No-Break">your company.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-263"><a id="_idTextAnchor262"/>Setting and meeting expectations in the program launch</h1>
			<p>As you launch <a id="_idIndexMarker755"/>your program, you should define what success is going to look and feel like to your stakeholders. Define clearly what they <a id="_idIndexMarker756"/>can expect from you and when. As you deliver against your commitments to your stakeholders, make sure you tell them what has happened, in addition to showing them. There are several ways you can show progress throughout your program. This will help your stakeholders see and be reminded of progress. With each milestone, issue some kind of <span class="No-Break">informational messaging:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Micro training</strong>: Small individual training (either live or pre-recorded videos) showing what can be done now that the release <span class="No-Break">has occurred.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Measured results</strong>: Show the results in terms of KPIs or other metrics. Publish the information in an easy-to-access-and-consume mechanism such as a dashboard or <span class="No-Break">internal website.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Before versus now</strong>: Show what can be done now that couldn’t be done before. Bonus: show what will be able to do in future releases to keep the excitement up among <span class="No-Break">your stakeholders.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Here is one<a id="_idIndexMarker757"/> final suggestion. As you plan your launch<a id="_idIndexMarker758"/> meetings, don’t wait to deliver. Get started now, and have a win already delivered since you started your strategy to show that you are not waiting to make an impact—the impact is already happening. Deliver the win ASAP, and announce it in your launch meetings. This will show the stakeholder community that you are anxious to deliver and you’re not waiting to make a difference. This is a great way to launch powerfully, and build immediate trust in your data <span class="No-Break">strategy delivery.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-264"><a id="_idTextAnchor263"/>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>As you learned in this chapter, launching powerfully is the best way to create momentum in your company’s data transformation. By moving quickly and comprehensively, and by anchoring in the maturity assessment (as covered in <a href="B18846_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor087"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>), you will have a firm foundation by which to generate significant impact to your organization. In this chapter, we covered the basics of a successful program launch, including <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>How to speak clearly and in <span class="No-Break">business terminology</span></li>
				<li>How to design communication patterns leading up to and <span class="No-Break">at launch</span></li>
				<li>Building a <span class="No-Break">launch plan</span></li>
				<li>Creating feedback loops to <span class="No-Break">gather inputs</span></li>
				<li>Incorporating feedback for even more <span class="No-Break">powerful messaging</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In the next chapter, I will walk you through how to identify and construct quick wins to help build velocity to your data transformation’s launch, so that you can gain the support and interest of your organization quickly and with impact. These two chapters build on each other to help you build tremendous credibility and support enterprise-wide. Be bold in how you launch your transformation, take appropriate credit for your team’s impact, and deliver tremendous results iteratively to generate support along <span class="No-Break">the way.</span></p>
