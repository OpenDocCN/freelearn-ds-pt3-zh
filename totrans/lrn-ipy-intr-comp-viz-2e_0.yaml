- en: You are a programmer using Python as a scripting language, maybe for software
    development. Learning IPython will let you use Python *interactively* in a highly
    efficient way, for example, when exploring algorithms or analyzing data. In addition,
    it is the best way to be introduced to the most advanced capabilities of the platform,
    namely numerical computing, interactive visualization, and parallel programming.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Getting Started with IPython"), *Getting
    Started with IPython*, is a short, hands-on introduction to the key features of
    IPython. It will give you a broad overview of what IPython offers. All features
    introduced in this chapter will be covered in the subsequent chapters.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Interactive Work with IPython"), *Interactive
    Work with IPython*, will show you how to use Python interactively from the IPython
    command-line interface, and how the numerous *magic commands* will help you considerably
    improve your productivity. This chapter will also introduce you to the IPython
    notebook, a modern tool for reproducible and collaborative interactive programming.'

    Computing with IPython*, contains an introduction to the numerical computing features
    of Numpy and Pandas, which can be conveniently used from IPython. These tools
    are essential as soon as you need to analyze large amounts of data, or more generally
    when you need to perform efficient numerical computations.'

    *Interactive Plotting and Graphical Interfaces*, covers the graphical capabilities
    of Matplotlib, and shows how they integrate smoothly in IPython. Matplotlib is
    a very powerful graphical library, which allows you to either generate high-quality
    figures or to visualize data interactively.'

    *High-Performance and Parallel Computing*, is an advanced chapter detailing various
    ways by which you can accelerate your code, such as parallel computing and dynamic
    C compilation. The former method consists in distributing tasks across cores or
    computers, which is particularly easy to do with IPython. The latter method lets
    you write code in a superset of Python (using the Cython library), which is then
    dynamically compiled in C for dramatic speed improvements.'

    shows you how you can customize IPython, create new magic commands, and use custom
    representations in the IPython notebook.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book assumes familiarity with the Python language. In addition, you will
    need to have a Python installation on your computer (Windows, OS X, or Linux).
    You will also need to install IPython as well as a few other external libraries.
    The installation procedures are detailed in [Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Getting
    Started with IPython"), *Getting Started with IPython*.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is intended for Python programmers who want to learn IPython for the
    advanced console, the notebook, and the interactive computing facilities offered
    by the platform. Students, hackers, scientists, and hobbyists who are interested
    in interactive computing, data analysis, and visualization will also be interested
    in this book, but will need to learn the basics of Python first. Fortunately,
    Python is a very accessible language, and a lot of books, courses, and tutorials
    are available.
