			<p>Designing patterns and the optimal flow of information throughout an organization is sometimes more art than science. When it comes to optimizing for information accessibility, enabling governance, and powering the use of data in a company, the use of data architecture as a strategic driver is often considered once it becomes clear that the way information is flowing is causing problems. Unfortunately, this leads to a shift in paradigm regarding how traditional architecture falls short in leveraging the power of data for a company. Organizations then need to determine how to design architecture to support the evolving needs of a company with a new paradigm: optimizing <span class="No-Break">for data.</span></p>
			<p>Traditional IT architecture is concerned with the design and implementation of IT systems and infrastructure to support business operations. It encompasses a wide range of technologies and components, including servers, storage, networking, and applications. Data architecture, on the other hand, is focused on the design and management of data assets within an organization. It encompasses the definition of data models, data standards, and data governance processes. This is why traditional IT architecture does not usually meet the needs of data users: it’s not designed with them <span class="No-Break">in mind.</span></p>
			<p>The key difference between traditional IT architecture and data architecture is that traditional IT architecture is focused on the systems and infrastructure that support business operations, while data architecture is focused on the data itself. In other words, traditional IT architecture is concerned with how data is collected, stored, and processed, while data architecture is concerned with how data is organized, defined, <span class="No-Break">and used.</span></p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-192"><a id="_idTextAnchor191"/>Data architecture defined</h1>
			<p>Data architecture refers to the design and structure of an organization’s data systems, including databases, data storage, data integration, and data management processes. It is a critical component of an organization’s overall IT infrastructure and plays a crucial role in how data is collected, stored, processed, and utilized within the organization. When building a home, blueprints serve as <a id="_idIndexMarker555"/>a plan for how the home is built. Similarly, in data governance, the data architecture serves as a blueprint for how data is built. Data architecture encompasses the design, development, and governance of data systems <span class="No-Break">and processes.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-193"><a id="_idTextAnchor192"/>Simple wins</h2>
			<p>When designing a data architecture, it is important to keep the guiding principle of <em class="italic">simplicity</em> in mind. A complex data architecture can be difficult to maintain and manage and can make it difficult to derive<a id="_idIndexMarker556"/> insights from data. A simple data architecture, on the other hand, is easier to understand and use and can help to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of data analytics. The scope of a strong data architecture includes the <span class="No-Break">following aspects:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data sources</strong>: Identifying where data is generated or collected, whether it’s from internal systems, external <a id="_idIndexMarker557"/>sources, or <span class="No-Break">user-generated content.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data storage</strong>: Determining how and where data is stored, whether it’s in traditional relational databases, NoSQL databases, data warehouses, or <span class="No-Break">data lakes.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data integration</strong>: Defining processes and mechanisms for combining and transforming data from different sources into a unified format for analysis <span class="No-Break">and reporting.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data processing</strong>: Deciding how data is processed, whether through batch processing, real-time streaming, or <span class="No-Break">other methods.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data access</strong>: Providing mechanisms for users and applications to access and retrieve <span class="No-Break">data efficiently.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Data architecture is an essential component of any organization that wants to get the most out of its data. A well-designed data architecture can help to improve data quality, accessibility, security, and compliance. It can<a id="_idIndexMarker558"/> also support data-driven decision-making and lead to improved <span class="No-Break">business performance.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-194"><a id="_idTextAnchor193"/>The value of data architecture</h1>
			<p>Overall, a well-designed data architecture is essential for any organization that wants to get the most out of its data. By following the principles of simplicity and scalability, organizations can design a data architecture that meets their current and future needs. A well-designed data architecture can help organizations do <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Drive implementation of strong data governance</strong>: By ensuring data is organized, stored, and processed efficiently, data architecture can reduce redundancies <span class="No-Break">and inconsistencies.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Improve data quality and consistency</strong>: By establishing standards and procedures for data collection, storage, and processing, data architecture can help to ensure that data is accurate, complete, and consistent across <span class="No-Break">all systems.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Increase data accessibility and usability</strong>: Data architecture can help to make data more accessible to users and easier to use for analysis. This can be done by developing data warehouses and data lakes, as well as by creating data models <span class="No-Break">and dashboards.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Enhance data security and compliance</strong>: Data architecture can help to protect data from unauthorized access and misuse. It can also help organizations to comply with data privacy and <span class="No-Break">security regulations.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Support data-driven decision-making</strong>: By making data more accessible and usable, data architecture can help organizations make better decisions based on data. This can lead to improved business performance and competitive advantage. A good data architecture facilitates data analytics, enabling businesses to derive valuable insights and make <span class="No-Break">data-driven decisions.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Ensure scalability</strong>: A well-designed data architecture should enable growth with the organization’s data needs and business needs as the company grows and expands. A tight connection with corporate strategy and data strategy should enable scalability to be <span class="No-Break">considered appropriately.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Enable security and compliance needs</strong>: Effective data architecture helps in maintaining data security and adhering to <span class="No-Break">regulatory requirements.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Drive cost efficiency</strong>: By optimizing data storage and processing, data architecture can lead to cost savings by simplifying storage costs, reducing the quantity of processing, and <span class="No-Break">removing redundancy.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="callout-heading">Optimizing for aggregation</p>
			<p class="callout">Consider a very large organization with decades of historical data. Data comes into the organization in hundreds of source <a id="_idIndexMarker559"/>systems, connecting and moving point to point, with no “target-state” or “North Star” architecture. You can imagine that this leads to<a id="_idIndexMarker560"/> redundancies, data quality issues, difficulty in extracting data needed, when needed, and a huge inconsistency in <span class="No-Break">information enterprise-wide.</span></p>
			<p class="callout">In this particular instance, the company built a plan to work strategically over time to better optimize the flow of information. This required a strategic approach to how particular datasets were managed, how they moved throughout the organization, what common data was needed (see <a href="B18846_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor206"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Primary Data</em>), and where it should <span class="No-Break">be conformed.</span></p>
			<p class="callout">Some key decisions that worked well in this build-out were <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li class="callout">What were we optimizing for? Cost? <span class="No-Break">Simplicity? Aggregation?</span></li>
				<li class="callout">Who was responsible for making <span class="No-Break">difficult decisions?</span></li>
				<li class="callout">How fast would we rearchitect <span class="No-Break">the company?</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="callout">These decisions were used to define the North Star by which the data architecture was designed. When you are considering a data architecture for your organization, these questions can help you define what the “target state” might look like and how you will chart the path <span class="No-Break">to implementation.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-195"><a id="_idTextAnchor194"/>Why data architecture is often overlooked</h2>
			<p>Data architecture is often overlooked in organizations for a number of reasons, including a lack of understanding of the benefits. Many organizations do not fully understand the benefits of data architecture, or they may not even be aware of it. Many organizations are focused on short-term gains, such as meeting quarterly revenue targets. Data architecture is often seen as a long-term investment, and it can be difficult to justify the cost and effort upfront. It’s also an expensive endeavor to change, and thus, most companies lack the<a id="_idIndexMarker561"/> patience and focus to have the long-range plan realized. Furthermore, data architecture can be complex, and it can be difficult to know where to start. This can be especially challenging for smaller organizations with limited resources. There is also a shortage of skilled data architects, and it can be difficult to find and hire <span class="No-Break">qualified candidates.</span></p>
			<p>Together, these challenges often lead to data architecture being de-prioritized or simply a consideration but not a binding mechanism by which decisions are made. This often leads data and analytical professionals to additional hardship in serving their stakeholders due to underlying complexities within the company’s <span class="No-Break">technical landscape.</span></p>
			<p>However, as a data professional, you must advocate for data architectural rigor, because data architecture is an essential component of any organization that wants to get the most out of its data. A well-designed data architecture can help organizations to improve data quality, accessibility, security, and compliance. It can also support data-driven decision-making and lead to improved <span class="No-Break">business performance.</span></p>
			<p>Here are some tips for overcoming the challenges of <span class="No-Break">data architecture:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Start with a clear understanding of your business needs</strong>: What are your business goals? What data do you need to achieve those goals? Once you have a clear understanding<a id="_idIndexMarker562"/> of your business needs, you can start to develop a data architecture that meets <span class="No-Break">those needs.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Take a phased approach</strong>: Data architecture is a complex undertaking, and it is important to take a phased approach. Start by developing a high-level overview of your data architecture. Then, you can start to implement the different components of your data architecture <span class="No-Break">in phases.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Invest in training and development</strong>: If you do not have the in-house skills to develop and implement a data architecture, you may want to invest in training and development<a id="_idIndexMarker563"/> for your staff. You may also want to consider hiring a consultant to help you <span class="No-Break">get started.</span></li>

							<p>Remember—implementing a target state data architecture is a multi-year, sometimes 5-7-year journey. Because companies are not likely to implement an entirely new parallel ecosystem, the strategic transition is typically executed in many phases. The most successful implementations I have been a part of had multiple phases: the first being what could be done quickly, and the second, where tools and platforms could be consolidated or retired. Subsequent phases are when more material changes must be made and require additional investment. It’s critical to keep putting this in front of individuals making funding decisions so that they can be reminded where you <span class="No-Break">are headed.</span></p>

			<p>It can also be helpful to measure the success of data architecture as clearly as possible so that executive management can see the value in data architecture more clearly. In this next section, I will share some specific ways to measure data architecture value so that you can build your business <span class="No-Break">case accordingly.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-196"><a id="_idTextAnchor195"/>Measures of success</h2>
			<p>Measuring success in terms of<a id="_idIndexMarker564"/> business value and outcomes requires a combination of quantitative and qualitative metrics to ensure that the data architecture aligns with the organization’s strategic goals and delivers tangible benefits. Regular monitoring and adjustments are essential to maintain the effectiveness of the data architecture as business needs evolve. Ideally, these measures will be defined by the head of data architecture, aligned with the chief architect, and supported by the users of data, business data stewards, and technical data stewards. The enterprise data committee should approve both the to-be architecture and these measures <span class="No-Break">of success.</span></p>
			<p>Example metrics could include<a id="_idIndexMarker565"/> <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Adoption</strong>: The number of users who have adopted the new data services or components of the prescribed <span class="No-Break">data architecture.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data quality</strong>: The number of data quality issues resolved due to the <span class="No-Break">new design.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Requirements</strong>: The number of data requirements met with the <span class="No-Break">new design.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Costs</strong>: Cost of replication saved due to new design. Measure cost savings achieved through optimized data storage <span class="No-Break">and processing.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Accessibility</strong>: How easily users and applications can access the data they need by measuring the time from request to closure <span class="No-Break">of ticket.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Performance</strong>: Speed of data processing and/or efficiency of <span class="No-Break">data retrieval.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Security and compliance</strong>: Track compliance with security and/or privacy regulations. Ensure that sensitive data is identified within the architecture and that the architecture enables compliance (for example, do not put sensitive data in multiple places; prioritize simplifying and reducing the number of locations with sensitive data as a <span class="No-Break">best practice).</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Scalability</strong>: Number of programs that leverage the new data architecture without <span class="No-Break">major modifications.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Additionally, be sure to design measures of success that quantify business impact. Assess how data architecture contributes to achieving business goals and objectives. This could include increased revenue, cost reductions, improved customer satisfaction, or other relevant business outcomes. These will vary greatly based on your business. Pulling users and business and technical data stewards in to help define business impact metrics is a <span class="No-Break">best practice.</span></p>
			<p>While not a specific measure, you should continuously gather feedback from users and stakeholders and use it to adapt and improve the data architecture over time. You may want to establish some “program” metrics <a id="_idIndexMarker566"/>to demonstrate early progress, such as the definition of guiding principles, first draft to-be state, and quantity of feedback provided. This will show engagement in the process and is a measure of success in the <span class="No-Break">definition stage.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-197"><a id="_idTextAnchor196"/>Core capabilities</h1>
			<p>Data architecture needs to be more flexible and dynamic than ever before. Companies are evolving quickly, and the <a id="_idIndexMarker567"/>speed at which <strong class="bold">generative AI</strong> (<strong class="bold">GenAI</strong>) has emerged is a perfect example of the ever-changing needs of corporations. You will note that the <a id="_idIndexMarker568"/>capabilities presented next are not specifying <em class="italic">which</em> technologies you need to deploy. That is up to you and your stakeholders to decide. The following capabilities tell <em class="italic">what</em> you need to define as a part of your data <span class="No-Break">architecture program.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-198"><a id="_idTextAnchor197"/>Establishing a data architecture program</h2>
			<p>Ideally, data architects should report to your chief data and analytics office. In some organizations, you will see the<a id="_idIndexMarker569"/> data architecture function report to the chief architect; however, in most cases, this results in data architects being less intimately familiar with the objectives of the company’s data strategy and results in less data-friendly models. It can work well when your chief architect understands data complexities well and is supportive of enabling data to flow appropriately as a priority for the overall <span class="No-Break">corporate architecture.</span></p>
			<p>Regardless of reporting structure, your company should stand up a formal data architecture program. There should be at least two levels of data architecture defined: first, the overall top-down data architecture, which defines what the enterprise-wide data architecture is, the principles, the target architecture, and enablement across the company; secondly, from more of a bottom-up perspective, data architects should be embedded in individual solutions, to ensure that individual solutions are designed in accordance with the overarching company-wide data architecture program. Both are critically important. I have seen instances where the top-down component sits with the chief architect and the bottom-up component sits with the chief data and analytics office. This can work when there is strong alignment, but when alignment is absent, the separation will not <span class="No-Break">be effective.</span></p>
			<p>As a part of the data architecture program, the head of data architecture should establish a “North Star” for how data architecture will be defined, designed, and implemented. In all successful data <a id="_idIndexMarker570"/>programs I have seen, the North Star has had three common components: strong as-is and to-be models, clear roles and responsibilities, and strong <span class="No-Break">executive support.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-199"><a id="_idTextAnchor198"/>As-is and to-be modeling</h2>
			<p>As-is and to-be data <a id="_idIndexMarker571"/>architecture are two key concepts in data management. As-is data architecture is the current state of an organization’s data landscape. It includes all of the data sources, systems, and processes that are used to manage and process data. As-is data architecture can be complex, especially in large organizations<a id="_idIndexMarker572"/> with many different departments and <strong class="bold">business units</strong> (<strong class="bold">BUs</strong>). To-be data architecture is the desired future state of an organization’s data landscape. It is a blueprint for how the organization wants its data to<a id="_idIndexMarker573"/> be managed and processed in the future. To-be data architecture is typically developed based on the organization’s business goals <span class="No-Break">and objectives.</span></p>
			<p>Begin by documenting the current state. This as-is state will help the enterprise understand what the current landscape looks like. You can create this diagram in as much detail as you need to, but be prepared to define a high-level view that is consumable for executives and drill-down views that are more appropriate for architects and engineers. If your organization is like most, your as-is state may look like spaghetti. This is because data integrations are often added without data in mind, and over time become <span class="No-Break">extremely complex:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer052" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18846_09_01.jpg" alt="Figure 9.1 – Current state architecture example"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.1 – Current state architecture example</p>
			<p>Defining a to-be data architecture is no small undertaking, especially if the organization has not historically been intentional about how it designs systems, data, or business flows. It has the potential to be a huge lift, due to the significant amount of cross-functional alignment required to<a id="_idIndexMarker574"/> create a target state that serves everyone’s needs. It will require compromise, thorough explanation, <span class="No-Break">and time.</span></p>
			<p>Once an organization has developed a to-be data architecture, it can begin to develop a plan to transition from its as-is state to its to-be state. This may involve making changes to existing systems and processes or implementing <a id="_idIndexMarker575"/>new systems and technologies. Here are some examples of the types of changes that may be involved in a data <span class="No-Break">architecture transformation:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Consolidating data sources</strong>: As-is data architecture may involve multiple disparate data sources, which can make it difficult to access and manage data effectively. To-be data architecture may involve consolidating these data sources into a single data warehouse or <span class="No-Break">data lake.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Implementing new data processing technologies</strong>: As-is data architecture may rely on outdated data processing technologies. To-be data architecture may involve implementing new technologies, such as big data processing platforms<a id="_idIndexMarker576"/> and <strong class="bold">machine learning</strong> (<strong class="bold">ML</strong>) algorithms, to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of <span class="No-Break">data processing.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Improving data governance</strong>: As-is data architecture may have poor data governance practices, which can lead to data quality issues and security risks. To-be data architecture may involve implementing new data governance policies and procedures to improve data quality <span class="No-Break">and security.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>A target or to-be architecture may look something <span class="No-Break">like this:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer053" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18846_09_02.jpg" alt="Figure 9.2 – Target state data architecture example"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.2 – Target state data architecture example</p>
			<p>In this to-be data architecture, note data for analytics is separated from operations. This will allow your analytics teams to be nimble in response to business requests, without slowing down or impacting the operations of the company. This is an intentional use case that I encourage you to critically consider for your organization. However, do not let this be the first of many diversions from simplicity. My guess is your company would benefit from “only” having two <a id="_idIndexMarker577"/>stores for data versus multiple. Most organizations, when they are starting their journey, have dozens, if not more, of data stores (sometimes within each division). Be diligent in identifying sources and the purposes <a id="_idIndexMarker578"/>of what you have and what you need before you start <span class="No-Break">making changes.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-200"><a id="_idTextAnchor199"/>Building an optimal data architecture capability</h1>
			<p>In the previous sections of this chapter, we went through what data architecture is, the value of data architecture, and<a id="_idIndexMarker579"/> the two primary phases: as-is and to-be. In this section, I will step you through how to build out your optimal capability for success. The key to them: be purposeful and intentional in how you define <span class="No-Break">your architecture.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-201"><a id="_idTextAnchor200"/>Establishing design principles</h2>
			<p>First and foremost, you should define a set of <strong class="bold">data architecture design principles</strong>. Design principles should be<a id="_idIndexMarker580"/> established to align all participants in the process to focus efforts and align the design to a common approach. Ideally, design <a id="_idIndexMarker581"/>principles will do <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Add simplicity <span class="No-Break">to chaos</span></li>
				<li>Drive a <span class="No-Break">simplified mindset</span></li>
				<li>Focus <span class="No-Break">the discussion</span></li>
				<li>Ensure consistency <span class="No-Break">in design</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Design principles should serve as the backbone of the process of designing data architecture. Aligning all participants to a core, foundational set of design principles will provide the lens by which all design decisions are made going forward. Once you get started in design, it becomes difficult to revert to set design principles, so I encourage you to start with setting these principles upfront, to avoid <span class="No-Break">rework later.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Example set of data architecture design principles</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="callout">The architecture is designed to scale with the evolving <span class="No-Break">business model.</span></li>
				<li class="callout">Business and data processes will be automated to the <span class="No-Break">extent possible.</span></li>
				<li class="callout">Data will be stored for central use and provisioned from the established authorized <span class="No-Break">provisioning points.</span></li>
				<li class="callout">Data will be reconciled or “mastered” according to documented <span class="No-Break">business rules.</span></li>
				<li class="callout">Users will have<a id="_idIndexMarker582"/> transparency into data quality and changes to the <span class="No-Break">data model.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-202"><a id="_idTextAnchor201"/>Developing architectural standards</h2>
			<p>A signal of a strong data<a id="_idIndexMarker583"/> architecture program is a defined set of data architectural standards. Data architectural standards set expectations for how architectural elements will be governed and what the approved models, access expectations, distribution models, and fundamental data assets control and set the use of information in a company. These standards should define what is expected for data for <span class="No-Break">any solution.</span></p>
			<p>Depending on the size and complexity of a solution, you may need to set expectations for involvement, approvals, and review processes. For example, if someone is making a small change (adding a column or adding a table to an existing solution), they may not need to go through a formal process, so long as they can attest that they are following data architectural standards. On the other hand, if a new ERP system is being deployed, the opposite should be true. An end-to-end design should be created documenting both current and future states, defining consumption patterns, establishing clear accountability and stewardship of newly defined or created datasets, and so on. You should ensure the standards include requirements, at a minimum, for <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Metadata management</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Data quality</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Data access</span></li>
				<li>Data distribution <span class="No-Break">and consumption</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>These standards should inform how the company makes platform choices and selects technology and tooling, and what integration patterns are used across the organization, in alignment with the design principles established previously. Business and technical data stewards should play an active role in designing data architectural standards so that their needs are met. Remember—these standards will set the evolution of data architecture and will <a id="_idIndexMarker584"/>not change everything overnight. They should serve as the North Star by which all future design choices <span class="No-Break">are held.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Establishing a to-be state</p>
			<p class="callout">I have seen two successful programs in my career (so far) that have leveraged the power of collective architecture across a company to enable the highest levels of optimization with technology and data investments. Both <em class="italic">could have</em> been <span class="No-Break">more successful.</span></p>
			<p class="callout">In both cases, the programs successfully and ruthlessly defined specific design principles by which the to-be architecture was defined; for example, tight expectations around the mandated use of reference data across the entire company, from a single source of truth. The result of this expectation would have led to a significant uplift in efficiency and ease in data aggregation enterprise-wide. However, in practice, the company was “softer” about the requirements of adoption. We entered the transformation with a firm expectation that we would require conformity and adoption of reference data within a 24-month period, but by the time we exited the program, we had relaxed this expectation to require the adoption of reference data only when “major” updates to the platforms occurred, which meant that the true benefit of reference data adoption would take years (5+). As with any long-term program, the momentum was lost, and the benefits were not <span class="No-Break">realized early.</span></p>
			<p class="callout">In the establishment of a to-be state, it’s critical that momentum is leveraged to drive change. These changes are very <a id="_idIndexMarker585"/>expensive and require clear focus to achieve the <strong class="bold">return on investment</strong> (<span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">ROI</strong></span><span class="No-Break">) desired.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-203"><a id="_idTextAnchor202"/>Tight integration with business architecture and IT architecture</h2>
			<p>One of the best ways to establish a strong architecture is to tightly integrate with business architecture, data<a id="_idIndexMarker586"/> architecture, and IT architecture. Most companies do not have a strong business architecture function. However, it can be the best way to evaluate the way in which the business operations should flow, the data that is required to support it, and the technology that will enable <span class="No-Break">optimal operations.</span></p>
			<p>The best practice would be to<a id="_idIndexMarker587"/> establish an <strong class="bold">architectural council</strong>. This should have representation from business, architecture, data, architecture, and IT architecture. Most companies do not focus on bringing these three types of architectural experts together, and therefore, when there are requirements for the business, data, or IT, they are often not considered holistically. By bringing these functions together, the company has an opportunity to streamline the design of simplistic and <span class="No-Break">effective solutions.</span></p>
			<p>Most companies do not focus on business architecture or assume it’s happening as a part of basic operations. It’s not. The architectural council can ensure that any architectural designs holistically account for all three vantage points. Selfishly, this ensures that data architecture is designed in a way that supports both optimal business processes and technology well. If either of these two other related architectural perspectives is not designed well, data architecture will not be effective. Thus, if your company does not have an architectural council, advocate for one. Ideally, this would be chaired by your chief architect and have representation across the business, inclusive of all three types <span class="No-Break">of architecture.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-204"><a id="_idTextAnchor203"/>Building data architecture into the systems development life-cycle process</h2>
			<p>Ideally, you will build a to-be state and transition plan with full funding and the support to transition in a few <a id="_idIndexMarker588"/>years. In reality, that is unlikely. Depending on the size, scale, and historical decisions of your company, the as-is state may be very difficult to unwind. You are going to be building the plane while it’s flying, which makes these types of programs extremely complex. Because of this, it’s much more common to see organizations <a id="_idIndexMarker589"/>build to-be design principles into the <strong class="bold">systems development life cycle</strong> (<strong class="bold">SDLC</strong>), for adoption <span class="No-Break">over time.</span></p>
			<p>The only way this will succeed, and that there will be a completion/end date to this program, is for a champion to continue to vocally drive the business value of the to-be state, have teeth in ensuring the to-be state is followed, and have the support of the executive team to make it happen. This can’t be followed only when it’s easy; it must also be followed when it is hard. The chief information officer can be a great advocate for you in this goal, as they typically hold the authority to approve or reject technical architecture in terms<a id="_idIndexMarker590"/> of programs. Ensure you have their full and unwavering support to bind the company to adopt the SDLC for <span class="No-Break">optimal success.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-205"><a id="_idTextAnchor204"/>Setting up data architecture for success</h1>
			<p>I’m confident you’ve noted that I have not defined <em class="italic">what</em> your data architecture should be in this chapter. I have<a id="_idIndexMarker591"/> given you the tools, the understanding, and the process by which to set up your data architecture program for success. Technologies change rapidly. The needs of companies vary widely. Only you can define what your company needs to use to build the optimal architecture for the data and analytical needs of your organization. I can’t possibly tell you what architecture is right for your company; only you can <span class="No-Break">do that.</span></p>
			<p>However, there are key factors that will set you up for success. These <em class="italic">are</em> consistent across companies both large and small, and will ensure you have a <span class="No-Break">successful program:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong class="bold">Appoint a chief data architect</strong>: Every company should have a person appointed to drive appropriate data architecture across the company. While you might not use this title per se, you should define the role and ensure they are empowered to make data architectural decisions for the enterprise as <span class="No-Break">a whole.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Define program routines and rhythms</strong>: Set up key program forums, reporting, and value storytelling to ensure the data architecture program is treated as a <span class="No-Break">formal program.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Involve the right people</strong>: Company historians who have a long-term history around why the company made the choices they did but who also have a futuristic view are excellent supporters of this work. They will understand why certain choices were made and what will break if changes are made. They can be the balance between urgency and thoughtful impact. Include your business architects, data architects, and IT architects from around <span class="No-Break">the organization.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Gain executive sponsorship</strong>: Ensure you have the right sponsor. This is usually a chief information officer or chief technical officer. Ensure they are willing to advocate for <a id="_idIndexMarker592"/>you at the top of the organization and adequately fund the <span class="No-Break">program long-term.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Align with the chief architect and chief data analytics officer</strong>: Ultimately, the chief architect must understand the importance of strong data architecture and why they need you to drive company-wide architectural success. Your chief data analytics officer also needs to sponsor this work. Ideally, the chief architect and chief data analytics officer co-chair this program, with the chief information officer or chief technical officer as the <span class="No-Break">executive sponsor.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Maintain a long-range mindset</strong>: You must remember these programs take time; they are long-range, and they require significant investment. They will not happen overnight. You must <span class="No-Break">have patience.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Invest strategically</strong>: Select a high-impact, shorter result window to show ROI. Invest in larger, more expensive components after you can show wins with impact. Do not wait to deliver the end result to show <span class="No-Break">the value.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Embed in the SDLC process</strong>: Bind the program to the SDLC process to ensure you adopt a to-be state <span class="No-Break">over time.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>By appointing the right people, defining strong routines and rhythms, and following a ruthless prioritization process, data architecture can be a strategic driver for your data and analytics function over time. It is a long game. It requires long-term thinking and ongoing support from the top of the organization to be successful. Your role as a data professional will have significant influence over the data and IT architectures’ ability to be successful and drive simple, elegant solutions that will drive optimized data for <span class="No-Break">the company.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-206"><a id="_idTextAnchor205"/>Conclusion</h1>
