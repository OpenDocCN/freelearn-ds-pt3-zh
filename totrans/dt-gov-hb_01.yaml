    have about data governance will be about data programs feeling like a series of
    constraints versus a strategic enabler and that you are slowing business down
    vs. enabling excellence. Having led data transformations in three Fortune 500
    companies, I have heard my fair share of these same messages. In my humble opinion,
    this is feedback; feedback that we are speaking in “data speak” and have not created
    a business case that is centered on value generation from the lens of our stakeholders.
    Rather, we have delivered a business case that is focused on data needs vs. business
    needs.

    that comes to mind for our stakeholders. It is embedded in how business runs.

    the business stakeholders we enable. When things feel like friction, it’s not
    necessarily because we’re not supported; it’s because we are one of many problems
    leaders are facing. Often, this comes in the form of a lack of buy-in or pushback,
    a seemingly endless number of questions, or simply a lack of engagement. For data
    professionals, conversations like this often end in frustration and the underfunding
    of the data governance program. I have seen this scenario over and over again
    in organizations firsthand and have heard it from data executives in every single

    the two so that your organization understands the definitions and how to use them
    appropriately in your organization. Personally, I do not believe either position
    is correct or incorrect. It is far more important that you meet your stakeholders
    where they are and that your organization agrees on the alignment you choose to
    use. For the purpose of this book, I will use the term “data” primarily, and I

    dollar transformation to comply with a regulatory requirement around data management
    and regulatory reporting. About six months into the effort, we found we were really
    struggling to define what was “in” vs. “out” of the scope of the program. After
    several curricular and passionate conversations, we learned that we were not able
    to scope well because, ultimately, our stakeholders had differing views about
    what constituted “data” vs. “metrics.” We ended up building a full-blown methodology
    to ground the company and our regulators on how we thought about the reports so
    as to be in scope, built a full list of all reports, and documented whether each
    one either met the criteria or did not meet the criteria, and this was to be available
    for a credible challenge to anyone or any group interested. Instead of debating
    it theoretically, we documented the criteria with specificity and then clearly
    articulated the justification.

    data team. Data governance (team or program) is not the solution to every problem.
    Data, like air, is everywhere in an organization, and it truly takes the entire
    organization to manage it well. Similar to the quality of air when a fire breaks
    out, poor data moves through an organization like smoke moves from a fire. The
    strong management of data requires prevention, detection, and correction, and
    to manage data well requires the entire company to be on board. A single data
    team cannot unilaterally solve every data problem. It will take the involvement
    and action of the organization at large to drive change and manage data effectively.

    liability is an obligation (either current or future) that decreases the overall
    value of the organization. Thus, when assets minus liabilities result in a positive
    value, the organization has an increase in value (i.e., has created equity), whereas
    when assets minus liabilities results in a negative value, the organization has
    a decrease in value (i.e., has reduced equity).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The same mindset can be applied to data. Data can impact equity in a number
    of ways. Equity can be created through addressing and minimizing operational risks
    by sustaining regulatory compliance, avoiding fines and penalties, and increasing
    or creating revenue. I break this concept down into two key subcomponents to manage
    data governance more specifically. These two subcomponents (assets and liabilities)
    are directly influenced by my formal training as an accountant and IT auditor,
    and this tends to resonate well with management when they translate data solutions
    into measurable value (ideally, monetary value, but may also consider the time
    value of employees).

    accordingly. The most important part of this valuation exercise is not the calculation
    itself; rather, it is the alignment and agreement with the business. Once you
    have calculated the value, it is important to go to the business and ask for their
    feedback. Do they agree with your assessment? If yes, then you have a fully vetted
    value for your data asset. If not, work with the business to iterate on your data
    asset valuation until you reach an agreement. If you skip this important step
    (vetting the value), data teams often are seen to be overselling their value to
    the organization. This immediately undermines your credibility in the organization.

    being deprioritized. Ultimately, organizations that drive successful data governance
    initiatives recognize the importance of good data governance and that it is more
    than just understanding records, fields, and tables. They recognize that it is
    more than just building another data warehouse. They recognize that people are

    Person A calls person D, and so on. Days or even months go by, and person A does

    of the easiest approaches to getting started is to begin at the executive level.
    I refer to these individuals as **data domain executives**. These are the individuals
    who are ultimately accountable for the data their division of the organization
    is accountable for. An example would be a **Chief People Officer** (**CPO**) being
    assigned the data domain executive for human resources data. This would make the
    CHRO ultimately accountable for human resources data. The CPO would delegate the
    day-to-day activities to their data steward, who would be responsible for ensuring
    human resources data is managed according to data governance policy and standards.

    domain executive, you will have the executives responsible for the data of the

    should assign a data steward to drive activities within their data domain. Often,
    organizations establish sub-groups (e.g., **human resources data councils** or
    **human resources data working groups**) to carry out the implementation and ongoing
    governance of the respective domain. This allows data governance activities to
    be implemented more deeply within the organization. The Chief Data Officer (or
    equivalent) should chair this committee and be responsible and accountable for
    managing the agenda, cadence, and facilitation, as well as reporting progress
    upward in the organization to the C-suite and the board of directors.

    be of concern (e.g., for vacation); however, if you start to see a pattern, either
    by a particular domain or across the board, it is a signal that your committee
    is not providing value. Quickly reach out to the data domain executive and seek
    to understand what is driving the delegation. Simply ask, “I noticed that you
    have delegated the last few EDC meetings to someone on your team. Is there anything
    I can do to make the meeting more engaging for you? Your perspective is critical
    for the whole committee, and I want to make sure it’s a valuable use of your time.”

    implementation of any data governance requirements set forth by the enterprise
    data governance policy and by the data domain executive or their delegate. We

    way to report this information is through the use of an **enterprise data governance

    status of how well the company is doing in implementing data governance capabilities

    (at minimum) to support your team’s data solutions. The relationship you build
    with your CIO and their key leaders is critical to your success. I’ve found the
    quality of the relationship between CDO and CIO to be one of the most powerful
    indicators of a CDO’s success. In cases where the CDO and CIO have a high-functioning
    and trusting relationship, I have witnessed success for both leaders. In cases
    where the relationship is not high-functioning or, at worst, competitive, the

    increasing threat landscape across all industries, the importance of the CISO
    has never been higher. One of the core tenants of the liability side of the data
    equity equation is the protection of your company’s data. This shows up in data
    security, of course, but also spans and tightly connects with technical metadata
    management. In short, you cannot protect data if you don’t know where it is. Technical
    metadata is a critical enabler that supports an understanding of what data you
    have, where it is stored, where it moves, how to classify it, and then what controls
    are needed to properly protect and secure it. We will cover more about this topic
    in *Chapters 6* and *7*. As a data leader, this capability will enable the success
    of your CISO, and therefore, I suggest you engage early and often with them throughout
    your data governance implementation.

    Your stakeholders should include the CIO and CISO, as mentioned in the preceding
    section, as well as the CFO, head of privacy, general council, human resources,
    and operations, in addition to business functions. If you work in the technology
    field, product and engineering leaders are critical, whereas in financial services,
    groups such as risk management and regulators may be relevant. The point is to
    look at the company at large, including all the stewards and users of data, and
    identify the key leaders you need to work with to partner effectively. Most data
    leaders who do not succeed in their role fail because they fail to build relationships

    Just like you can’t get in shape for one race and then claim you have become in
    shape for life and go back to sitting on the couch and expect to maintain the
    results. Take the time to secure support and funding for the program upfront.
    Your success and the company’s success depend on it.

- en: Once you have built the framing for your business case and you have decided
    what capabilities you need, you should come up with some options for a timeline
    and funding. I find it’s best to put forward three options for management so you
    can have a healthy discussion about what to do, how fast to do it, and how much
    the company is willing to spend to deliver.

    and you can obtain adequate funding to do the work at a pace you feel is appropriate,
    what is that timeline? When will you release new capabilities? What will the company
    be able to do at each release?

    (the funding, headcount, or consultants’ involvement). This option gives a faster
    time to value but comes with the balance of an increase in costs.

    this is often the option that is thrown out right away by executives. Once they
    decide to move forward with data, they want to see results. Having this option
    on the table demonstrates that you were thoughtful and considered all options,
    and although they are not your preference, you considered the expectations of
    others.

    review discussions. Be open minded. If management is putting forth their time
    and energy to review these options with you, this is a good sign. Listen to their
    feedback and be willing to come back with alternatives. Ultimately, you are aiming
    to receive support and funding; the more flexible you can be, the more likely
    you are to gain support.

- en: Beginning a journey to establish data governance transformation in your organization
    doesn’t have to be difficult. It can take time, and requires support, but you
    can establish a strong data governance function for your organization. There are
    a few key steps that you should focus on as you embark on this journey, starting
    with identifying a data governance leader to own and sponsor data governance for
    your company, which will establish authority over the data governance function.
    You will also need to define what data governance means in the context of your
    company, through publishing a data governance policy (and standards, if needed).
    By carrying forward that policy implementation through establishing clear owners
    (e.g., data domain executives), establishing appropriate councils and committees,
    and writing a strong business case.

    to drive data governance into the ethos of your company, first, by establishing
    a coalition of advocates. In [*Chapter 2*](B18846_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor041),
    I will begin by explaining why a coalition matters, how to assess possible supporters,
    and how to g[ather broad support.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/05/21/how-much-data-do-we-create-every-day-the-mind-blowing-stats-everyone-should-read/?sh=302772a160ba)
