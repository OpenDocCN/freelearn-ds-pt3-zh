- en: If data is the new oil, then machine learning is the drill. As companies gain
    access to ever-increasing quantities of raw data, the ability to deliver state-of-the-art
    predictive models that support business decision-making becomes more and more
    valuable.

- en: In this book, you'll work on an end-to-end project based around a realistic
    data set and split up into bite-sized practical exercises. This creates a case-study
    approach that simulates the working conditions you'll experience in real-world
    data science projects.

    scikit-learn, and master the process of data exploration and data processing,
    before moving on to fitting, evaluating, and tuning algorithms such as regularized
    logistic regression and random forest.

    to get started with data science and machine learning. If you''re keen to advance
    your career by using data analysis and predictive modeling to generate business
    insights, then this book is the perfect place to begin. To quickly grasp the concepts
    covered, it is recommended that you have basic experience with programming in
    Python or another similar language (R, Matlab, C, etc). Additionally, knowledge
    of statistics that would be covered in a basic course, including topics such as
    probability and linear regression, or a willingness to learn about these on your
    own while reading this book would be useful.'
