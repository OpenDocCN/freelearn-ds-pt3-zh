- en: In data discovery and analysis, you will likely create numerous data visualizations.
    Each of these visualizations gives you a snapshot of a story within the data.
    Each insight into the data answers a question or two. At times, the discovery
    and analysis phase is enough for you to make a key decision and the cycle is complete.
    In other cases, you will need to bring the snapshots together to communicate a
    complete and compelling story to your intended audience.

    dashboard. This dashboard could be a static view of various aspects of the data
    or a fully interactive environment, allowing users to dynamically filter, drill

  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: From a Tableau perspective, a **dashboard** is an arrangement of individual
    visualizations, along with other components, such as legends, filters, parameters,
    text, containers, images, extensions, buttons, and web objects, that are arranged
    on a single canvas. Ideally, the visualizations and components should work together
    to tell a complete and compelling data story. Dashboards are usually (but not
    always) interactive.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The primary objective of a dashboard is to communicate data to a certain audience
    with an intended result. Often, we'll talk about *telling the data story*. That
    is, there is a narrative (or multiple narratives) contained within the data that
    can be communicated to others.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While you can tell a data story with a single visualization or even a series
    of complex dashboards, a single Tableau dashboard is the most common way to communicate
    a single story. Each dashboard seeks to tell a story by giving a clear picture
    of certain information. Before framing the story, you should understand what story
    the data tells. How you tell the story will depend on numerous factors, such as
    your audience, the way the audience will access the dashboard, and what response
    you want to elicit from your audience.

- en: Stephen Few, one of the leading experts in the field of data visualization,
    defines a dashboard as *a visual display of the most important information that's
    needed to achieve one or more objectives, consolidated and arranged on a single
    screen so the information can be monitored at a glance*.

    may range from giving information to providing an interface for further exploration,

    objectives. Your discovery and analysis should have uncovered various insights
    into the data and its story. Now, it's your responsibility to package that discovery
    and analysis into a meaningful communication of the story to your particular audience
    in a way that meets your objectives and their needs. The way you handle this task
    is called your **approach**.

    have a deep understanding of the implications of the data story. Often, it can
    be helpful to design a dashboard that guides your audience through a similar process
    of making the discoveries for themselves, so the need to act is clear. For example,
    you may have discovered wasteful spending in the marketing department, but the
    team may not be ready to accept your results unless they can see how the data
    led you to that conclusion.'
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Exploratory**: Many times, you do not know what story the data will tell
    when the data is refreshed in the next hour, next week, or next year. What may
    not be a significant aspect of the story today might be a major decision point
    in the future. In these cases, your goal is to provide your audience with an analytical
    tool that gives them the ability to explore and interact with various aspects
    of the data on their own. For example, today, customer satisfaction is high across
    all regions. However, your dashboard needs to give your organization the ability
    to continually track satisfaction over time, dynamically filter by product and
    price, and observe any correlations with factors such as quality and delivery
    time.'

    Indicators** (**KPIs**) or metrics that indicate good versus poor performance.
    You don''t need to guide the audience through discovery or force them to explore.
    They just need a high-level summary and the ability to drill down into details
    to quickly find and fix problems and reward success. For example, you may have
    a dashboard that simply shows how many support tickets are still unresolved. The
    manager can pull up the dashboard on a mobile device and immediately take action
    if necessary.'

    of exploration, guided analysis, or performance indication, but primarily you
    are telling a single story from the data. For example, you may desire to tell
    the story of the spread of an invasive species of insect, including where it started,
    how quickly it spread, the results, and the efforts to contain it. Your dashboard
    should tell the story, using data, in a visual way.'
