			<h1 id="_idParaDest-266"><a id="_idTextAnchor265"/>Delivering Quick Wins with Impact</h1>
			<p>As you launch your data transformation program, your team will quickly and consistently deliver results. Because of the nature of data governance, and skeptics of the practice of data translating into real, measurable results, you will need to shorten the time to first value as much as possible, and crisply and consistently show progress. In this chapter, I will walk you through how to create momentum with quick wins, how to communicate these wins effectively to and with the business, and how to ensure the business stakeholders understand how your results translate into <span class="No-Break">their success.</span></p>
			<p>In my experience, data leaders who bet exclusively on big, transformational platforms often lose stakeholder interest by the time their results are realized. You can’t wait until your platforms or capabilities are launched to claim victory. In my experience, big-bang solutions are critical, but they can’t be everything. No stakeholder group or company will wait 18-24 months to see results on their data investments. Results have to happen in bite-sized moments while you simultaneously deliver <span class="No-Break">incremental results.</span></p>
			<p>According to Deloitte’s research (see the <em class="italic">Further reading</em> section at the end of this chapter), the average tenure of a chief data and analytics officer is approximately two and a half years, compared to other C-suite executives’ average tenure of approximately five years. Because of this, it is critical that you show you can deliver sustainable, measurable success. Your success in the role depends on it. As you begin with this pressure in mind, do not let it paralyze you, but rather, use it for fuel. Be mindful that you must consistently show up, every day, and <span class="No-Break">demonstrate impact.</span></p>
			<p>First things first, you will need to determine what constitutes a “quick win.” What will that mean? What’s worthwhile for your stakeholders versus what is important to you? I recommend you start by answering these questions for you and your team. Hiring is an example of something you will need to do but it isn’t a “win” in the eyes of your stakeholders. Fixing a long-standing data quality issue that is causing executive-level metric errors, however, is a win that you should celebrate and communicate. So, what does it take to identify a quick win? We’ll <span class="No-Break">start there.</span></p>
			<p>This chapter covers the <span class="No-Break">following topics:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Finding <span class="No-Break">quick wins</span></li>
				<li>Why policies, standards, and procedures can <span class="No-Break">generate buzz</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Data ownership</span></li>
				<li>Applying a product mindset to <span class="No-Break">data capabilities</span></li>
				<li>Building momentum through a continuous <span class="No-Break">delivery model</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-267"><a id="_idTextAnchor266"/>Finding quick wins</h1>
			<p>As you were <a id="_idIndexMarker759"/>coming up to speed and meeting with your initial stakeholders, as we went through in <a href="B18846_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor041"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></span></a>, you listened to stakeholders’ concerns, what was going well, and what wasn’t going well, and you started to better understand what their needs were. Now is the time to work with them to develop the priority list of what they need now, and what they need in the long term. This is where you refine that priority list of needs with your team and with stakeholder groups so that you can make a big impact in <span class="No-Break">your organization.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-268"><a id="_idTextAnchor267"/>Identifying areas of need</h2>
			<p>As you continue to build these relationships, a key step in building trust is delivering what you <a id="_idIndexMarker760"/>said you would. As you met with stakeholders, you should have captured the list of their needs. In raw form, it might look something <span class="No-Break">like this:</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Table 13.1 - A sample of identified issues through stakeholder interviews</p>
			<p>These are just a few examples of what you might have heard when speaking with your stakeholders. You <a id="_idIndexMarker761"/>could have dozens of issues identified that you heard during your listening tour. Write them all out by domain, even repeats across groups. Next, you should do <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Share the individual lists back to the individuals you met with. A simple, “thank you for meeting me, this is what I heard, did I miss anything?” can be super helpful. It may spark new ideas and/or clarify anything you didn’t <span class="No-Break">capture correctly.</span></li>
				<li>Meet with your team, share the lists with them, and share what you heard. Ask the team for input. You may find they are aware of other issues that exist (of any size or scale) that you can add to <span class="No-Break">the list.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Once you’ve landed on a stable list of current issues or missing capabilities that are impacting the business and/or back office functions from their success, the next step is to look at what exists across groups and what exists in individual groups. This means looking for common themes, but also where there are variances so that you can determine what needs to be done for multiple stakeholders, and what serves only a <span class="No-Break">single group.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-269"><a id="_idTextAnchor268"/>Rationalizing the list</h2>
			<p>As you review the list, you will see the themes. I have highlighted two consistent themes in the short <a id="_idIndexMarker762"/>example below for reference. Note, in one example, the wording is the same so it is easy to identify, but the second issue is not exactly worded the same. This is intentional. You must be well versed in the list. Simply having the list is not enough. You have to know the content well. The issue with consistent language would be picked up using matching logic in a spreadsheet (if you have a long list) but the other would not be. This is to provide an example of why it’s important to be intimate with <span class="No-Break">the list.</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Table 13.2 - Identified common issues across divisions, reformatted</p>
			<p>From this view, you should seek to identify which of these issues could be solved, at least in a meaningful way, in the short term. The idea isn’t to necessarily solve all problems immediately, or completely, but to show meaningful progress for the stakeholders <a id="_idIndexMarker764"/>in a short time horizon. By solving quick wins, you drive trust with stakeholders that you can make meaningful change happen for them. This will demonstrate near-term urgency in service of a long-term, <span class="No-Break">sustainable view.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-270"><a id="_idTextAnchor269"/>Prioritizing the list</h2>
			<p>Now that <a id="_idIndexMarker765"/>you have the list, the next step in the process is to determine what you should focus on, and in what order. There are a few questions you and your team should ask to help prioritize <span class="No-Break">the focus:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>What is the impact of solving <span class="No-Break">each issue?</span></li>
				<li>How will you measure success? Time saved? Revenue generated? Cost avoidance? How will you quantify <span class="No-Break">the impact?</span></li>
				<li>What is <span class="No-Break">the urgency?</span></li>
				<li>What could be done now to solve an urgent issue versus what needs to be done more sustainably long term? Is it worth it to solve part of the <span class="No-Break">issue now?</span></li>
				<li>Do you have the people you need to solve the <span class="No-Break">issue? Expertise?</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="callout-heading">Example – unable to see purchase history by customer</p>
			<p class="callout"><strong class="bold">Scenario</strong>: In this <a id="_idIndexMarker766"/>example, the company sells a subscription product with add-on <span class="No-Break">support services.</span></p>
			<p class="callout"><strong class="bold">Needs for sales</strong>: Sales professionals need to be able to see what a customer has purchased so they can 1) sell them additional, complementary products and services and 2) know what to renew for future years. Without this information, the sales team is left asking the customer, “What have you purchased?” This can lead to a poor customer experience and a loss of revenue opportunity for renewal products. Customers are often not renewed, leading to attrition of <span class="No-Break">the revenue.</span></p>
			<p class="callout"><strong class="bold">Needs for customer success</strong>: Customer success agents are unable to see what customers have purchased, so they don’t know whether a customer is entitled to a particular level of support when they call the call center. They have to trust the <a id="_idIndexMarker767"/>customer at their word and have no way to verify their eligibility for the services. This leads to the assumption of overserving the customer but at the expense <span class="No-Break">of revenue.</span></p>
			<h4>Prioritization framework</h4>
			<p>Now that we've captured the list, let's define how to build a framework to prioritize the list. Consider <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">The impact of solving issues on the business</strong>: Both sales and service are risking a <a id="_idIndexMarker768"/>leakage of revenue, either in upsell or resell opportunities for sales, and for add-on services/support for customer success. Additionally, we may be over-servicing customers without adequately charging them for the services they need, increasing our cost to serve by <span class="No-Break">over-serving customers.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">How to measure success and impact</strong>: Put yourself in the position of the business. Ask yourself the following questions: What will the business be able to do when this problem is addressed that they can’t have or experience today? How will I measure that? In this example, revenue is a result of this problem, as well as over-providing services, which increases the cost per customer for services because we are providing services to customers (at least at increased levels) than they are entitled to. One measure is the percentage of revenue renewed, another is the cost to serve per customer, and the last, finally, <span class="No-Break">is attrition.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Urgency</strong>: Revenue leakage and costs to serve are usually pretty critical items for management. It is safe to assume sales, service, and executive management would be very interested in solving this issue with a high degree <span class="No-Break">of urgency.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Immediate work versus long-term work</strong>: In this step, you and your team should brainstorm ways to approach this issue both in the very short term, but also in a long-term and sustainable way. What is something you could do today, this week, <span class="No-Break">this year?</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Resourcing</strong>: What investment might you need to complete this short- and long-term project? Do you have anything available at your disposal today, by reprioritizing or creating a stretch assignment for someone on your team? Do you <span class="No-Break">need funding?</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>After <a id="_idIndexMarker769"/>assessing each issue like the preceding example, you should re-prioritize the list to the sequence in which you intend to solve the issues. You don’t need to take them one at a time. In fact, you may want to select 5-10 problems and attack all quick wins with different parts of your team at once. If I were tackling this same list, I would put my data governance team on the ownership item from finance, the platforms/primary data team on the unified view of the customer issue, and my data operations team on this purchase history example we are <span class="No-Break">exploring together.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-271"><a id="_idTextAnchor270"/>Short-term versus long-term wins</h2>
			<p>Within <a id="_idIndexMarker770"/>a common issue or capability, you <a id="_idIndexMarker771"/>should have short-term solutions <a id="_idIndexMarker772"/>that qualify as a quick win, and long-term solutions for the same issue, which get to a stable solution for the long haul. So, how do <span class="No-Break">you decide?</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong class="bold">Create optionality</strong>: Come up with some options for your stakeholders to consider. Ideally, propose three options that address <span class="No-Break">their problems.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Involve stakeholders</strong>: Get their perspective on the options you propose. Ask curious questions such as “What are we missing? What else could be impacted as a result of <span class="No-Break">these options?”</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Use what you have</strong>: Consider the resources you have. It can be seen as a red flag when you ask for funding and/or resources every time you need to do something new. What could you do without a single dollar or <span class="No-Break">new headcount?</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Show progress (versus tell)</strong>: Schedule regular check-ins with your stakeholders as you have progress to show. Showing the progress versus sending a status report is worth so much in credibility. Show them how you are helping <span class="No-Break">them win.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Iterate</strong>: To demonstrate progress quickly, you need to show incremental progress. As you deliver features, show and solicit feedback quickly. Maintain a sense of urgency while <span class="No-Break">you iterate.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Demo</strong>: Take your iterative solutions to your stakeholders and show them what you and your team have created. Get their early and frequent feedback so that you can <a id="_idIndexMarker773"/>demonstrate forward progress, and include any feedback as you deliver for them. Don’t wait until the <a id="_idIndexMarker774"/>solution is built to show them <a id="_idIndexMarker775"/>what you’ve done in service of <span class="No-Break">their needs.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Go live</strong>: Simply, turn your solution on. You will continue to iterate and deliver new features once you deliver the initial capability, so, go live <span class="No-Break">with urgency.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Communicate far and wide</strong>: Share your solution with your stakeholders, but also with others. Add this new solution to a monthly communication, or a status report that you share with a broader community of stakeholders. This will be a great way to show others that you have delivered a solution <span class="No-Break">with impact.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Fail fast</strong>: If the solution isn’t working, or you need to change course, don’t be afraid to do so. Just do it quickly. You can <span class="No-Break">always pivot.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Build the long-term solution</strong>: After you have deployed or delivered the first iteration that quickly addresses your stakeholders’ needs, get to work on building the long-term solution. That may mean delivering more sustainable solutions/releases than what you delivered as your quick win, or it could be a totally different sustainable solution. Either way, once you have delivered the quick win, the next step is to immediately get to stable <span class="No-Break">long-term needs.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Example – unable to see a complete view of historical purchases by customer</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Scenario</strong>: In this example, the company sells a subscription product with add-on support <a id="_idIndexMarker776"/>services. In the current state, the sales and customer service teams were unable to verify what the customer had purchased, and therefore were running into two <span class="No-Break">primary problems:</span><ul><li>Customer service representatives were not sure which level of service package a customer was entitled to, which leads to over- <span class="No-Break">or under-service.</span></li><li>Sales representatives were unsure what the customer had purchased previously and therefore were not sure what to renew. This led to revenue being <span class="No-Break">left unbilled.</span></li></ul></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Short-term/quick win objective</strong>: Build a simple lookup on top of the ERP data to identify the lost revenue that was not being renewed. This revenue leakage identification would be able to justify the additional spending for the long-term solution. (Note: this is a very common issue, and in large enterprises, it often results in 10s or 100s of millions of dollars of unbilled revenue <span class="No-Break">being identified.)</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Long-term objective</strong>: Build a purchase history tool that shows all the history of customers for marketing, sales, customer services, and finance to be able to easily look up all of the history for any <span class="No-Break">customer globally.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">What to consider</strong>: As you are starting to build the quick win versus the long-term portion of the solution, you’ll need to look at what’s available to you. Following the preceding 10 steps, you first need to come up with a variety of options for your stakeholders to consider. Ideally, you should be able to propose three or more options to address their problems. Second, you’ll want to involve your stakeholders in the selection of these options. You should ask them questions about the options <span class="No-Break">you prepared.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">What we did</strong>: In this example, we prepared options that included being able to take raw transactional data from our enterprise resource planning platform and curate a view based on that information, which was not of the highest quality but was enough to get the team started. This addressed <em class="italic">Step 3</em>, which is to use what you have. As we worked toward <em class="italic">Step 4</em>, we started to show the stakeholder groups what the raw data from the ERP system looked like. Even though the <a id="_idIndexMarker777"/>data was not very complete or comprehensive, it gave them a place to start from. We worked with our stakeholders to provide an iterative view of what we were able to remediate quickly based on other data sources that we had available in <span class="No-Break">our ecosystem.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>By iterating with our stakeholders, we also demonstrated our solutions by placing a very simple GUI interface on top of the data set, which allows the stakeholders to be able to search for <a id="_idIndexMarker778"/>the history that they need. Once we had enough confidence from our stakeholders that this would begin to address their problem, we made it live for them, and we communicated effectively that the data in this version was not fully reliable, but was enough to get started. We also shared this early iteration <a id="_idIndexMarker779"/>with other teams that we thought might be interested in this information. There were other teams in IT, finance, and marketing that were also interested in this <span class="No-Break">initial view.</span></p>
			<p>Long term, we needed to build a primary data management platform for customers, so we had full confidence we had a complete view of a customer and the hierarchies around a single entity. Ultimately, we automated the purchase history platform, linked the purchase history to the appropriate customer, and had the ability to see purchase history at the lowest legal entity, as well as the ability to roll up the purchase history to the ultimate parent (highest level). We iteratively delivered until the stakeholders involved had a fully automated end-to-end sustainable solution. We saved the company millions in operational efficiency and <span class="No-Break">lost revenue.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-272"><a id="_idTextAnchor271"/>Organizational readiness considerations</h2>
			<p>It may be <a id="_idIndexMarker780"/>surprising to note that a similar recommendation had been made a few years prior but was not approved by the business. Why might that be? Well, sometimes organizations don’t understand what their opportunity is because of a variety of external factors. Or, it could simply be that the previous pitch was not made very effectively. Just because it didn’t work before doesn’t mean it won’t work now. If your stakeholders don’t accept your recommendations the first time, wait a period of time and then try again. Especially when there are leadership changes, you may want to consider that new leaders may have <span class="No-Break">new ideas.</span></p>
			<p>You should also consider the state of the company. If the company is going through a rough financial time, it’s likely not the right time to request millions of dollars to push your data <a id="_idIndexMarker781"/>agenda. Get really focused on what you need to deliver, why the company needs it, and what the financial outcomes will be if you do. Simply stating your solution will deliver “revenue” isn’t sufficient. Be clear on how and why. If the company is in a financial growth mode, it might be a better time to experiment <span class="No-Break">and innovate.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-273"><a id="_idTextAnchor272"/>Investment/funding models</h2>
			<p>Typically, there are a couple of ways to go about funding these quick wins. These different <a id="_idIndexMarker782"/>options may vary based on your organizational preferences. There are commonly three options <span class="No-Break">to consider:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong class="bold">CDAO office funding</strong>: You use your own budget to fund this quick-win project. This <a id="_idIndexMarker783"/>is my recommendation for when you are trying to demonstrate your team’s ability to deliver. This is often viewed as a “goodwill” attempt to show <span class="No-Break">reputable results.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Stakeholders’ funding</strong>: You ask your stakeholders to fund your quick-win project. I would <a id="_idIndexMarker784"/>recommend this only when you have a good standing you’re your stakeholders and they are used to funding work for <span class="No-Break">your team.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Hybrid funding</strong>: You ask your stakeholders to fund part of the solution and you offer <a id="_idIndexMarker785"/>to fund the other part of the solution. This can work when there is a bit more investment needed to get the project off the ground, appreciation from both sides that the quick win is critical, and alignment on the shared success <span class="No-Break">of delivery.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In my experience, it’s a stronger relationship builder when your team self-funds the quick win and goes to the stakeholder for funding only when you have demonstrated that your team can deliver. Only once you exit the “quick win” phase and move on to delivering the long-term sustainable solution should you request funding from stakeholders. Use your best judgment and follow the norms of your company’s <span class="No-Break">funding model.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-274"><a id="_idTextAnchor273"/>Follow through</h2>
			<p>This should be a no-brainer, but you have to deliver excellent results in a quick win if you want to <a id="_idIndexMarker786"/>be taken seriously by your stakeholders. There’s really no room for failure, especially if your stakeholder is funding your quick-win project. There are lots of ways to “win,” but you have to deliver a result that meets or exceeds <span class="No-Break">their expectation.</span></p>
			<p>Once you deliver that very first iteration, you should immediately ask for input into the next iterations of your solution. Each and every delivery that you have in this quick-win phase builds small amounts of credibility and trust in your teams’ ability to deliver what the business needs. Keep showing the stakeholders that they can depend on you for excellent results, and that you are their partner. Work with them to ideate on the next steps and keep delivering. This virtuous cycle of delivery will pay dividends when you move into the larger deliveries in <span class="No-Break">your program.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-275"><a id="_idTextAnchor274"/>Communicate effectively for support</h2>
			<p>After all the preceding work, identifying, producing, and iterating on results through continuous <a id="_idIndexMarker787"/>delivery, it is a shame that many data leaders fail to communicate appropriately. There tend to be two camps: over-communicating on less-than-impactful results or not communicating enough about impactful delivery. Think about it in this very <span class="No-Break">simple view:</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Table 13.3 - Impact of quick wins and communication effectiveness</p>
			<p>You want <a id="_idIndexMarker788"/>to be in the top-right box – high impact and effective communication. However, the next best place to be is the lower-left box. This is probably unexpected, however, the other two carry a higher degree of risk for the success of <span class="No-Break">your team.</span></p>
			<h3>Measuring results</h3>
			<p>As you are communicating, do not forget what we learned in <a href="B18846_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor110"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Aligning on Outcomes</em>. It is critical that you measure the impact of the results you deliver. For example, in the purchase history example we went through earlier, we identified unbilled revenue that customers had committed to renewing but hadn’t been renewed by sales. In the example, from the financial transactions and order forms, we were able to identify <a id="_idIndexMarker789"/>the years of commitment, what had already been billed and paid, and what had not been billed and paid. The unbilled commitments were able to be measured and aggregated. The unbilled revenue totaled in the millions <span class="No-Break">of dollars.</span></p>
			<p>By reporting outwardly to all stakeholder groups, including finance, sales, and executive management, we were able to state very concretely that the team had identified the specific dollar amount of unbilled revenue. As sales took that data and followed up with customers, most were very happy to pay for the services, but no one had asked them to. They also were unaware. I have heard this exact same example play out in numerous <span class="No-Break">other companies.</span></p>
			<p>Data teams that can directly identify a revenue improvement from their work often find funding their programs much easier to do than when measuring results is less direct, or when there is not a direct revenue or operational savings tie. If you can, measure results specifically and share very clearly. Obtain your stakeholders’ support for the number you identify and go together to executive management to share the outcomes. This will bolster your credibility and partnerships. Now that we’ve learned all about quick wins, in the next section, we’ll explore how policies, standards, and procedures can help you <span class="No-Break">achieve them.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-276"><a id="_idTextAnchor275"/>Why policies, standards, and procedures can generate buzz</h1>
			<p>One of the easiest quick wins that you can deliver on the data governance side of your team is to <a id="_idIndexMarker790"/>establish effective and easy-to-understand policies, standards, and procedures. In <a id="_idIndexMarker791"/>my experience, some of your stakeholders will simply want <a id="_idIndexMarker792"/>to be able to self-deliver. I think this is a great signal. It means that you have highly qualified data professionals across your organization who want to be able to get started. However, if they are looking to your team to tell them what to do, how to do it, and how they want to do it in alignment with your team, then these are <span class="No-Break">engaged stakeholders.</span></p>
			<p>One of the best things you can do is provide them with the guidance that they are seeking. The easiest way to do this is to publish guidelines that they can use. While some of your data engineers and analytics professionals are delivering on other quick wins, focused on the more technical components of data governance, other team members can concurrently be focusing on delivering these documents, which can support the <span class="No-Break">broader enterprise.</span></p>
			<p>Especially if your team is small or new, producing simple, straightforward, and not overly complex policies, standards, and procedures is a great way to engage the entire company in <a id="_idIndexMarker793"/>data without a significantly sized team. Simply providing templates is a very easy way to engage your stewardship community on how to best document simple controls, define how to measure and report on the state of data quality, or perform simple <span class="No-Break">data operations.</span></p>
			<p>While the <a id="_idIndexMarker794"/>preceding example of purchase history gets deep in a single area, policies, standards, and procedures cut wide across your organization. By marrying a <a id="_idIndexMarker795"/>technical solution with a more generalized solution, such as a simple data policy, you will gain support from a few different stakeholder groups. This is another way to build effective momentum in your data program while enabling the company to know what they need to do and how they need to do it. After publishing policies, standards, and procedures, and delivering a data governance capability, one of the next best steps that you can take is to define clear data ownership. By assigning data owners, you can operationalize your data governance in a federated model that will deliver accountability across <span class="No-Break">the enterprise.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-277"><a id="_idTextAnchor276"/>Data ownership</h1>
			<p>In <a href="B18846_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor057"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></span></a>, we went through how to build a high-performing team. You may recall that building a high-performing team isn’t just about your direct reporting staff, but also the entire data <a id="_idIndexMarker796"/>community across the company. One of the most important considerations in building a high-performing team is activating those who manage the data directly. These data stewards (both technical and business data stewards) are a key component to operationalizing all of the capabilities we discussed in <em class="italic">Part 2</em> of this book, but also in implementing policies, standards, <span class="No-Break">and procedures.</span></p>
			<p>One way to get a quick win is to activate your stewardship community. The data governance leader, which we covered in <a href="B18846_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor057"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></span></a>, should identify who data stewards are across the organization and use these stewards to implement the policies, standards, and procedures, but also to identify quick wins! The individuals closest to the data are the ones who see and experience the data issues day to day, and thus, are your biggest source of input when it comes to identifying <span class="No-Break">quick-fix opportunities.</span></p>
			<p>Be sure to <a id="_idIndexMarker797"/>keep track of who is providing you with these ideas as they come in. A few things you can try are <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Create a hackathon</strong>: Activate your community by capturing ideas that need solving. Then, push these ideas back to the community and create a contest-like forum to “hack” these ideas into solutions. Ask an executive to take the winners to lunch or host an <strong class="bold">ask me anything</strong> (<strong class="bold">AMA</strong>) as a prize. Note that this doesn’t <span class="No-Break">require funding.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Ask for submissions</strong>: One way to gather ideas is to create a forum to submit ideas. You could use a Slack channel or simply collect them through a monitored <span class="No-Break">email box.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Create a sign-up form</strong>: Allow individuals to log their ideas on a form. Be sure to capture who submitted the ideas so you can <span class="No-Break">acknowledge them.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>By engaging the entire data community, your reach and idea set will become much richer and wider than if your team attempted to gather ideas or generate ideas exclusively on their own. There is a great deal of pride in ownership for ideas that are gathered, so, celebrate the individuals who brought them forward. When solutions are gathered, solved, and communicated, be sure to mention and publish who brought it forward. This is a great way to honor those who are supporting your team and data more broadly at the company. Now that we have learned what data ownership is, and how it helps define quick wins, we’ll now learn how to apply the product mindset to <span class="No-Break">finalize solutions.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-278"><a id="_idTextAnchor277"/>Applying a product mindset to data capabilities</h1>
			<p>One of the best ways to continue to iterate on a solution is by adopting a product mindset to <a id="_idIndexMarker798"/>your data capabilities. This concept has been emerging in the data space for the last few years and I’ve driven this model in two teams I’ve led at the time of writing. The best way to think about adopting this mindset is to look at how products are deployed in the technology industry. It’s a great time to think about this as you are building solutions under the data product mindset because it fundamentally aligns with <span class="No-Break">product management.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-279"><a id="_idTextAnchor278"/>Product management for data</h2>
			<p>As you <a id="_idIndexMarker799"/>start to build a solution, the idea is that you <a id="_idIndexMarker800"/>go live with an immediate <strong class="bold">minimum viable product</strong> (<strong class="bold">MVP</strong>) solution and continue to release new features periodically over time. Ideally, you should follow the following steps, at <span class="No-Break">a minimum:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong class="bold">Assign a product manager</strong>: Each solution should have an assigned product manager who “owns” the solution. The product manager should be the expert on the solution, and accountable for the quality and performance of the solution. Much like you would see with a traditional technology product, this person is ultimately accountable, no <span class="No-Break">matter what.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Leverage a feature backlog and prioritize</strong>: Collect all the features requested by stakeholders and those needed to improve the data product. Prioritize the features based on impact <span class="No-Break">and needs.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Build a roadmap</strong>: Each product should have a roadmap with features being released iteratively over time. It should be clear and transparent to the stakeholders what they can expect, and when, with regard to the <span class="No-Break">data product.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Deliver iteratively</strong>: As depicted on your roadmap, the data product should have clear, iterative deliveries over time. This roadmap should not “end” – you should adopt a continuous <span class="No-Break">improvement model.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Enable users</strong>: As you deliver, be sure to enable the users with training so they can use the product to its <span class="No-Break">full potential.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Repeat</strong>: Because you are deploying a product, you should continue to repeat this cycle indefinitely or until the product <span class="No-Break">is retired.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Because your goal is to get a solution into production quickly, and to deliver that quick win, focus on delivering the MVP so that your stakeholders can get value as fast as possible. Leverage the preceding steps to get to your full solution, with future enhancements. Do not let perfect be the enemy of good; deliver <span class="No-Break">with urgency.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-280"><a id="_idTextAnchor279"/>Products versus non-product solutions</h2>
			<p>Once <a id="_idIndexMarker801"/>you see how <a id="_idIndexMarker802"/>effective this approach is, it may <a id="_idIndexMarker803"/>be tempting to apply the product management mindset to all data capabilities and solutions. However, not everything should be treated as such. It becomes very easy to become captivated by this model and want to apply the model to everything, but it does come with a cost: aligning a product manager and engineering team to each product is not <span class="No-Break">scalable infinitely.</span></p>

			<h3>Basic criteria</h3>
			<p>To aid your <a id="_idIndexMarker804"/>team in staying objective, you should create basic criteria to use for your company, which will define what constitutes a product, service, or asset.

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Table 13.4 – Criteria for various data solutions</p>
			<p>In the first <a id="_idIndexMarker805"/>organization that I deployed this model in, we went through every single thing we did, no matter whether it was a simple dashboard, a curated dataset, or a full-blown solution, and we determined which of the three buckets each solution fit into. Simply going through this exercise allowed us to retire a number of dashboards we realized not only weren’t products, but weren’t being used at all. It crystallized for us what we needed to be doing, versus what we could stop doing altogether. From there, we identified which solutions were true products, and we could start to iterative <span class="No-Break">quick wins.</span></p>
			<h3>Product culture</h3>
			<p>As you focus <a id="_idIndexMarker806"/>on delivering quick wins with iterative delivery, a good best practice is to identify and appoint an individual to define product management best practices for your team. This individual will define the preceding criteria, establish forums for product roadmap reviews, manage the process for scrum, and partner with engineering teams to align both product and engineering to the same goals. By defining these expectations, you will begin to establish a culture of product management. Depending on the size of your company and data team, this could be a part-time role or a <span class="No-Break">full team.</span></p>
			<h3>Training</h3>
			<p>You will need <a id="_idIndexMarker807"/>to define requirements for product management (both for quick wins and for ongoing product management). Especially if this concept is new to your company or your team, you will need to spend time training. There are some online programs focused on data product management, which could be a good place to start. If you find you have to DIY a training program that is customized for your company, you can. There’s no single way to accomplish training. What’s most important is that you assess the needs of your team and company, and train accordingly. Now that we’ve covered how to build quick wins and walked through some examples, we need to focus <span class="No-Break">on momentum</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-281"><a id="_idTextAnchor280"/>Building momentum through a continuous delivery model</h1>
			<p>Quick wins <a id="_idIndexMarker808"/>are not just something that you create and deliver in the early phases of your tenure – they’re quite the opposite. You should create quick wins to build momentum, and then keep delivering with velocity over time. The best way to create momentum is by devising a <strong class="bold">continuous </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">delivery model</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-282"><a id="_idTextAnchor281"/>Continuous delivery model</h2>
			<p>A continuous delivery model enables your team to further deliver against each solution, by adopting the product mindset discussed previously, as well as using the same model to identify and <a id="_idIndexMarker809"/>deliver new quick win opportunities. The same model applies to both an individual solution, as well as the process overall, which makes it easier to deploy across your team. For engineers, this may look a lot like an agile delivery model, which it is modeled after. For non-engineers, this is the opportunity to learn from our technical counterparts and adopt their processes more broadly to solutions holistically. The following image provides a visual representation of how the continuous delivery model operates. Note that there isn’t an end to this model, rather, you should continue through the process as long as the data product is in production and used by <span class="No-Break">your stakeholders.</span></p>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 13.2 – Building a momentum flywheel – continuous delivery model</p>
			<p>We will <a id="_idIndexMarker810"/>explore each stage of the model in the <span class="No-Break">following subsections.</span></p>
			<h3>Intake</h3>
			<p>At a team level, you should create a process and mechanism to collect and document all the solutions <a id="_idIndexMarker811"/>that you will build, regardless of size. You may use a tool to do this, such as Jira or Asana, or you could use something as simple as a spreadsheet. Regardless of what tool you use, be sure to capture ideas both big <span class="No-Break">and small.</span></p>
			<p>At the solution level, you will need to capture new features or changes that are required for each individual solution you are building/maintaining. Because the model is continuous in nature, you should be evaluating enhancements, new features, and fixes on an <span class="No-Break">ongoing basis.</span></p>
			<h3>Prioritization</h3>
			<p>At the team level, you should review the solutions that have been logged in your backlog <a id="_idIndexMarker812"/>for prioritization. Ideally, you would define a prioritization framework. It can be as simple or as complex as you need to fit your business needs, however, I find a lot of elegance in a simple solution such as <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Impact</strong></span><span class="No-Break">: Low/medium/high</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Cost/resourcing</strong></span><span class="No-Break">: Low/medium/high</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Seems simple, and simple can be great. To prioritize at the solution level, you are simply prioritizing these solutions to deliver rapid impact on the business. This prioritization framework can help you identify which solutions to go after based on your resourcing. For example, if someone has a week of capacity, and a week of effort is considered a “low” cost for your organization, you might search the list for a low-cost and high-impact solution to work <span class="No-Break">on next.</span></p>
			<p>At the solution level, you can use something similar to build prioritization at the feature level, such as <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Impact</strong></span><span class="No-Break">: Low/medium/high</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Cost/resourcing</strong></span><span class="No-Break">: Hours/days/weeks</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>You could use the actual expected hours to complete the features (e.g., 2 hours or 36 hours). This will also help you prioritize the feature backlog for each solution <span class="No-Break">you create.</span></p>
			<table id="table007-1" class="No-Table-Style _idGenTablePara-1">

					<tr class="No-Table-Style">
						<td class="No-Table-Style">
							<p>Across both the team level and solution level, this prioritization approach will also help you identify where there is work to deliver that may not be considered “quick.” Perhaps this process will identify where you have larger-scale needs, such as what was covered in <em class="italic">Part 2</em> of <span class="No-Break">this book.</span></p>
						</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
			<h3>Building a roadmap and aligning features</h3>
			<p>At the team level, once you have the prioritization framework pulled together, you should build <a id="_idIndexMarker813"/>an integrated roadmap of the small quick-win projects your team will continue to deliver. This view will help <a id="_idIndexMarker814"/>your combined team have visibility into and understand what is being delivered. By providing micro-moments with stakeholders that your team is able to drive, you will delight your stakeholders, but you will also build confidence in your team’s ability to deliver impactful work at velocity. This will inspire your team to find more quick wins and thus, will generate <span class="No-Break">more momentum.</span></p>
			<p>At the solution level, you should build a simplified view of the releases you will have for your quick wins. This should be shared not only with the individuals working on the solution but also with your stakeholders. By showing them what this will look like, they will understand better what features and/or functionality will be available to them and when. Be sure to not just mention what is available, but also what that will enable them to be able to do in business terms (e.g., a customer-level health score will enable the customer success team to proactively reach out to customers and delight them with an improved customer experience and a higher <span class="No-Break">NPS score).</span></p>
			<h3>Building/engineering/analyzing</h3>
			<p>At <a id="_idIndexMarker815"/>the team level and the solution level, this step, simply <a id="_idIndexMarker816"/>put, is to execute your plan. Deliver <a id="_idIndexMarker817"/>the solution <span class="No-Break">with excellence.</span></p>
			<h3>Delivering</h3>
			<p>At the team level, this is a great time to show the stakeholder community, perhaps through your <a id="_idIndexMarker818"/>enterprise data committee or council, on a quarterly basis, what has been delivered. Depending on the willingness of the stakeholders, it can be very powerful for the stakeholders to present in this forum what they are able to do now that they have received the solutions your team <span class="No-Break">has delivered.</span></p>
			<p>At the solution level, after you build the solution (for example, a dashboard, a curated data set, or a new pipeline), you should deliver this solution to your stakeholders. Don’t forget to show them exactly what they can do with the solution and how to use it. Ask for immediate impressions <span class="No-Break">and feedback.</span></p>
			<h3>Repeat/iterate</h3>
			<p>At the team level, continue to generate ideas, follow your intake process, and iterate through the continuous delivery model for impact. This is a great time to also add up the impact your <a id="_idIndexMarker819"/>team has created through the sum of your quick wins process. Consider the tracking time saved, revenue added, cost saved, and so on. Keep this information at the most granular level possible so you can provide the details. However, the aggregate number can add up very quickly to demonstrate the <span class="No-Break">team’s value.</span></p>
			<p>At the solution level, after delivery, you should take the feedback and input from the delivery step, and repeat the entire flywheel, starting with intake. Ask what additional features or functionality they need, and continuously deliver through the cycle again. As long as the solution exists, this process should continue. Once the solution is no longer needed or used, then retire it, but until that time, continue to follow this continuous delivery model <span class="No-Break">for impact.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-283"><a id="_idTextAnchor282"/>Follow through</h2>
			<p>This may go without saying, but you must follow through on your commitments in these quick wins. They can’t be wins if you don’t deliver against them. By honoring your commitments <a id="_idIndexMarker820"/>to your stakeholders, you begin to build trust. If you find you are not going to be able to deliver, or you get into the solution build, and you determine it’s far more complex than expected, go communicate with your stakeholders. Do not shy away from giving news regarding the success or failure of the quick win process. Not everything will work and that <span class="No-Break">is OK.</span></p>
			<p>Being transparent, working with your stakeholders, and truly partnering through these processes with visibility will continue to build trust. You may consider asking your stakeholders to co-develop with you for added business integration. This approach can be quite helpful if your team is new to the company, or you have a large number of new team members joining the team. Celebrate the wins, big and small, and also celebrate the failures. When a team member quickly realizes something isn’t going to work and stops working on the solution (e.g., fails fast), that is also something to celebrate. It will create a culture of innovation where it is safe to try things and fail. Failure isn’t failure – it’s part of success. Be sure to encourage this on your team, so you keep motivation within <span class="No-Break">your team.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-284"><a id="_idTextAnchor283"/>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>As you establish a culture of building quick wins for impact, you are creating a machine of delivery within your team that will help build your reputation as a dependable and innovative team. Most organizations do not build this culture, and are constantly asking for the big projects, and unwilling to start small. There is no reason not to do both. By investing in quick wins and the process to deliver them early, you build momentum fast. By adopting the continuous delivery model and data product mindset, your teams can deliver incremental and powerful value in a predictable, <span class="No-Break">scalable way.</span></p>
			<p>Be mindful to capture how you will measure the quality and impact of your quick wins so that you are able to tell your value story quickly and effectively. There is a great deal of power in being able to quantify your impact on the company quickly and effectively. This will captivate your stakeholders, elevate your team’s impact, and create additional demand for your team’s services. Everyone wins with <span class="No-Break">this model.</span></p>
			<p>Starting strong is a key indicator of a strong data organization, as well as a strong leader in the data and analytics space. Building momentum early and continuously will carry you and your team to success. If you need ideas, consider bringing the team together to hack a list of ideas together. Whatever you do, don’t go stagnant. Continue to deliver with a focus on high-quality outcomes of any size. You will build a delivery model that can’t be beat. The next chapter will help drive even faster wins, through the incorporation of automation to further build your virtuous cycle <span class="No-Break">of impact.</span></p>
