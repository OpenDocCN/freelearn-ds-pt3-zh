			<h1 id="_idParaDest-43"><a id="_idTextAnchor042"/>How to Build a Coalition of Advocates</h1>
			<p>Arguably the most important part of launching a data governance program that drives impact is gaining support for your program. Given the velocity of data creation worldwide, the impact on company operations (positive when properly managed, not so positive when managed poorly), the degree of risk of data misuse and mismanagement carry, and the opportunity that comes with value creation, it is no surprise that data is a hot topic with staying power. In every company I have worked for, customers, employees, and peers across all industries are asking a very common and <span class="No-Break">consistent question:</span></p>
			<p><em class="italic">How can we build trust in </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">our data?</em></span></p>
			<p>The concept of trust is complex. You cannot buy it. You cannot snap your fingers and create it. It takes time to create and seconds to lose. What is interesting about applying the concept of trust to data is that users of data often presume the data is wrong and that they can’t trust it, especially when the data is not what they expected it to be. I often joke that “data is guilty until proven innocent,” and it is often the way data is treated in practice. As data practitioners, the burden falls on our shoulders to prove data is reliable and to drive trust. Our colleagues demand it. Our customers demand it. The burden is ours <span class="No-Break">to bear.</span></p>
			<p>But it goes much further than “Is the data correct and trustworthy?” as our job reaches far beyond simply reporting. <strong class="bold">Chief Data and Analytics Officers</strong> (<strong class="bold">CDAOs</strong>) are truth-tellers, architects, engineers, and monetization leaders. Without the broad focus across capabilities, the role of a CDAO dilutes to reporting only. You will not build trust by being a reporting shop. Our job is to build trust across the organization not just in reports but in data solutions that impact business <span class="No-Break">outcomes directly.</span></p>
			<p>In a recent study by <em class="italic">McKinsey</em> [1], it was determined that customers “<em class="italic">consider trustworthiness and data protection to be nearly as important as price and delivery time</em>.” It is no longer enough to be the most reasonably priced or have the highest quality delivery. Customers want to trust the company and believe their data will be protected appropriately while doing business, as well as after the transaction occurs. They want to trust <em class="italic">you</em> to care for their data well. The combination of the dramatic increase in the quantity of data and the customer expectation to care for their data well puts <strong class="bold">Chief Data Officers</strong> (<strong class="bold">CDOs</strong>)/CDAOs in the middle of the conversation about trust in a new and <span class="No-Break">elevated way.</span></p>
			<p><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">No pressure</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>Historically, CDAOs have worked through the lens of risk reduction, operational efficiency, and/or increasing revenue. This focus and demand for a trust-first approach requires a new dimension of thinking and a new focus on expectations. How do we manage data well, at an ever-increasing scale, while meeting the expectations of customers, partners, and employees? How do you bring the company along on the journey to data governance excellence? How <em class="italic">exactly</em> do we build trust in data in this <span class="No-Break">new world?</span></p>
			<p>It starts with <em class="italic">you</em>. We have to build trust with the people we do <span class="No-Break">business with.</span></p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following <span class="No-Break">main topics:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Building relationships <span class="No-Break">with impact</span></li>
				<li>Landing an <span class="No-Break">executive sponsor</span></li>
				<li>Establishing <span class="No-Break">feedback loops</span></li>
				<li>Key roles to <span class="No-Break">support you</span></li>
				<li>How to gain the support of <span class="No-Break">the masses</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Knowing that relationships are a core component of building trusted relationships and excellent data solutions, let's dive into how to build relationships <span class="No-Break">with impact.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-44"><a id="_idTextAnchor043"/>Building relationships with impact</h1>
			<p>Because data and analytics are a core <a id="_idIndexMarker087"/>tenet of any digital business, CDAOs have to take accountability for measurable results tied to business outcomes. You serve the company end to end and top to bottom. You have to build support from this perspective. Without getting too deep into the foundations of neuropsychology, the coalition of advocates you need to build trust in data must start with building trust in you. Your colleagues and stakeholders must believe that <em class="italic">you</em> can bring order to chaos. They must believe that you can drive this change. Ultimately, the relationships you build early in your program can either make or break your success. According to <em class="italic">Gartner</em>, “<em class="italic">Culture and literacy are the top two roadblocks for data and analytics leaders.</em>” (<em class="italic">10 Ways CDOs Can Succeed in Forging a Data-Driven Organization</em>, published May 22, 2019, Gartner.) These two terms “<em class="italic">culture</em>” and “<em class="italic">literacy</em>” are thrown around in the<a id="_idIndexMarker088"/> data <span class="No-Break">industry constantly.</span></p>
			<p>Unpopular opinion: I don’t like either of them. Let’s explore <span class="No-Break">this further:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Culture</strong> is defined as “<em class="italic">the customary beliefs, social forms, and material traits of a racial, religious, or social group</em>” [2]. Thus, it’s not about creating a data culture; it’s about creating a culture where data is a foundational component of the culture of the company: a bias for data over opinion, and facts over feelings. It’s about making data a part of the everyday workings of the company – not as a separate “data culture,” but woven into the overall culture of <span class="No-Break">the company.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="callout-heading">Data culture failures</p>
			<p class="callout">In my experience, when CDAOs push a “data culture,” they send a message that data is more important than other components of culture, and I wholeheartedly disagree with this approach. I have seen CDAOs fail by pushing this agenda. Instead, it’s far more effective to push the integration of data into the culture not as a separate initiative but as a part of the <span class="No-Break">company’s DNA.</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Literacy</strong> is defined as “<em class="italic">able to read and write</em>; <em class="italic">having knowledge or competence</em>” [4]. Thus, the purpose of data literacy programs is to empower the company as a whole to be able to read and use data and have competence in data use; however, launching a program for data literacy also tends to fall flat. Instead, I recommend incorporating data into all programs (that is, policy training, compliance, and alongside technical training as a technical competence). Treating the general knowledge around data like other general competencies will make the learning feel more organic to the average employee, and creating focused training for the technical creators (for example, data engineers), makes this focus more natural for the company to adopt. Forcing the executive team to sit through “data literacy” programs/trainings is often off-putting at best and insulting at worst. Find a way to<a id="_idIndexMarker089"/> make this learning natural, and you will find the program to be more successful <span class="No-Break">and welcomed.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>While some may suggest you need to create a data culture in your organization with force and formality, what I believe is more tangible, measurable, and appropriate: build trust. <em class="italic">Through</em> building trust, you will improve the overall data culture and increase data literacy. Don’t make the mistake of launching a “literacy” campaign or a “culture” program. Build trust through <em class="italic">delivery</em>, and the culture will come; data-driven decision-making will improve (for example, literacy). You must establish yourself and your team(s) as business peers to core business leaders, not simply internal <strong class="bold">service providers</strong> (<strong class="bold">SPs</strong>), driving tangible <span class="No-Break">business impact.</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Trust</strong> is defined as “<em class="italic">assured reliance on the character, ability, strength, or trust in someone or something; one in which confidence is placed</em>” [3]. I would much rather focus on building confidence in data, in me, and in my teams’ capabilities and deliveries than focusing on literacy or culture. In my experience, focusing on building trust in data is a far more elevated and mature level of data governance than launching a literacy campaign. Is literacy a part of the program? Yes, of course, but it is simply one part of the program. One must focus on building a trusted data governance program, and literacy <span class="No-Break">will follow.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Therefore, for the purposes of this chapter and, furthermore, this book, I will focus on how to build trusted solutions that empower data-driven decision-making through the delivery of world-class data governance programs <span class="No-Break">and solutions.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Building trust</p>
			<p class="callout">As Anna Jankowska stated <span class="No-Break">in </span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Forbes</em></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>
			<p class="callout">“<em class="italic">Until you know the other party and their needs well enough, you will not be able to provide value. Your judgment may be biased and grounded in previous business experiences. Instead, you have to provide a totally objective and emotionally uninvolved perspective. Only then are you qualified to discuss their business needs and pain points and show them how your solution can enhance </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">their performance.</em></span><span class="No-Break">”</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-45"><a id="_idTextAnchor044"/>Building trust one relationship at a time</h2>
			<p>Building trust happens in each interaction you have with your stakeholders. They are not just looking for trust in the results – they are building trust in you to deliver those results. There are a few ways you<a id="_idIndexMarker090"/> can go about bringing the company on your journey to build trust in data. You could drive it as a compliance exercise (aka…the “stick” method), which is based on driving data governance activities because you “have to” do them. You could do it purely by incentive (aka…the “carrot” method), which is based on driving data governance activities through incentives. Or, you could build a coalition of advocates and drive data governance from all sides. The latter is by far the most effective and the method with the most <span class="No-Break">staying power.</span></p>
			<p>This approach also shifts the burden off of only your shoulders and creates an environment where the whole company plays a part in the success of the program. In other words, it makes data governance a team sport. In this team of advocates, you are the team captain and ultimately accountable for the success (or failure) of the program, but you are no <span class="No-Break">longer alone.</span></p>
			<p>A more traditional approach to onboarding into a new CDAO or CDO role would suggest you work with peers to gather information cross-functionally, across the organization. I have found this only gives you a filtered view of the workings of the company because you are working at a layer of management that receives a filtered view of the organization. A broader and more inclusive approach involves <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong class="bold">Horizontal</strong>: Speaking with peers across the organization (yes – the <span class="No-Break">traditional approach).</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Up</strong>: Speaking with your manager (maybe C-suite; maybe the CEO) and the Board <span class="No-Break">of Directors.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Down</strong>: Listening to your team (direct and indirect reports) to hear what is happening in your org and where your opportunities <span class="No-Break">are within.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Across</strong>: Talk to larger groups of individuals at all levels to get a well-rounded understanding. This may include groups of individuals working on a large cross-functional project or teams within another part of the organization. Be strategic about how you select these groups, but do sample across the organization widely to get a <span class="No-Break">broad understanding.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Out</strong>: Connect with vendors, consultants, and individuals who have left the company (including your<a id="_idIndexMarker091"/> predecessor, if applicable). Outside-in perspectives can help you learn what people are unwilling or unable to <span class="No-Break">tell you.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>This well-rounded approach results in a broad group of people feeling engaged and willing to support you long-term. This group feels seen and heard and thus is more likely to support you and your team. Ask for recommendations and solutions. Stakeholders will feel like their input matters. Circle back to the broad group and share what you heard and what you did with their input. If you considered it and went a different way, that’s OK! Share it anyway. If you included it, <span class="No-Break">show them.</span></p>
			<p>Additionally, I recommend you conduct 1:1 meetings, small groups, and larger group listening sessions to gather input. Some individuals are more comfortable 1:1, whereas others may prefer a larger group setting. No matter what models you use, establish trust and build rapport with the person or people you are meeting with. They need to feel seen and that you are truly listening <span class="No-Break">to them.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-46"><a id="_idTextAnchor045"/>Identifying stakeholders</h2>
			<p>While it’s tempting to dive<a id="_idIndexMarker092"/> right in and try to speak to everyone, I recommend starting with building a stakeholder map. This exercise will be grounding for you when it comes to measuring impact and success on an ongoing basis. Remember – not all stakeholders will hold equal prioritization. It does not mean they are not all important; they are. You will need to evaluate each one and work together to prioritize the most meaningful and impactful outcomes as you build your business case and strategy. Planning these interactions has a direct correlation to your chances of success in <span class="No-Break">this role.</span></p>
			<p>Start by listing out your stakeholders <span class="No-Break">into groups:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Internal</strong>: Stakeholders who are employed by <span class="No-Break">your company</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">External</strong>: Stakeholders who are not employed by your company but have a relationship with the organization in <span class="No-Break">some way</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>When identifying the types <a id="_idIndexMarker093"/>of stakeholders in each group, consider who will be impacted the most based on whether your team and work are successful or if you fail. Additionally, you will need to prioritize these stakeholders as you build out your business case and delivery plan, so it’s important to get to a manageable level of granularity (too many, and it will be too much to track; too few, and you won’t be specific enough to define what you will do for each <span class="No-Break">business group).</span></p>
			<p>In the next two tables, I will show an internal stakeholder and external stakeholder examples, to help contextualize the <span class="No-Break">information above.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Internal stakeholder groups – a banking example</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="callout">Individual contributors – tellers <span class="No-Break">or analysts</span></li>
				<li class="callout">Managers – branch managers or <span class="No-Break">credit managers</span></li>
				<li class="callout">Divisional leaders – community banking district leaders or credit <span class="No-Break">risk VP</span></li>
				<li class="callout">Executive team – community banking executive VP or chief credit <span class="No-Break">risk officer</span></li>
				<li class="callout">Board <span class="No-Break">of Directors</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="callout-heading">External stakeholder groups – a banking example</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="callout">Customers – checking account holders or <span class="No-Break">loan applicant</span></li>
				<li class="callout">Partners – loan origination <span class="No-Break">third-party vendor</span></li>
				<li class="callout">Vendors/suppliers – credit reporting agency (for example, <span class="No-Break">Experian, TransUnion)</span></li>
				<li class="callout">Investors – <span class="No-Break">stockholders</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>As you consider your <a id="_idIndexMarker094"/>own organization, it can be helpful to model out the mapping by customer, partner, vendor/suppliers, and investors like the example above. However, the definition of external <span class="No-Break">is broadening:</span></p>
			<table id="table001-1" class="No-Table-Style">
				<colgroup>
					<col/>
				</colgroup>
				<tbody>
					<tr class="No-Table-Style">
						<td class="No-Table-Style">
							<p><strong class="bold">Hint </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">for success</strong></span></p>
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr class="No-Table-Style">
						<td class="No-Table-Style">
							<p>More recently, I have seen companies take a broader view with regard to external stakeholders. Some companies have started considering stakeholders such as the environment to define the duty they believe to have to support or protect the world. Depending on your company’s business, you may have additional internal and/or external stakeholders that <span class="No-Break">make sense.</span></p>
						</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
			<p>For each group, identify what their most critical priorities are. Consider asking or researching <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>What is their role within <span class="No-Break">the organization?</span></li>
				<li>Is their relationship generally positive <span class="No-Break">or negative?</span></li>
				<li>How do they contribute or benefit from <span class="No-Break">the organization?</span></li>
				<li>What does success mean <span class="No-Break">to them?</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Start by building out your stakeholder map with these answers into a table or template that you can refer to as you build out your business case and deliver against your program. There are a number of formats you can use, but a template such as this can get <span class="No-Break">you started:</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Table 2.2 – Internal Stakeholder Group Example</p>
			<p>As you work to identify and<a id="_idIndexMarker099"/> define your strategy, you need to answer the following question: How will you enable your stakeholders to achieve their goals through building trust <span class="No-Break">in data?</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-47"><a id="_idTextAnchor046"/>Building a stakeholder map</h2>
			<p>To begin to identify and align <a id="_idIndexMarker100"/>outcomes for your program, start by building a stakeholder map. A stakeholder map is an evergreen document that you should build together with your team. The map identifies all stakeholder groups that you will be supporting and/or are already supporting. I recommend making this stakeholder <a id="_idIndexMarker101"/>map available for your team. You may also want to open it up to your stakeholders for transparency, alignment, and ongoing quarterly <span class="No-Break">business reviews.</span></p>
			<h3>Getting started</h3>
			<p>To begin to make a stakeholder map, start by defining the purpose of the stakeholder map so that you and your team members are grounded on why the map is important and why it will matter in the future. One simple statement you can leverage is, “<em class="italic">The purpose of this stakeholder map is to identify who we are serving, what their objectives are, how we are enabling their success, and our measures of success in delivering for them.</em>” To create the stakeholder map, gather the <span class="No-Break">following inputs:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Company strategy</span></li>
				<li>Company <span class="No-Break">organizational chart</span></li>
				<li>Current portfolio <span class="No-Break">of work</span></li>
				<li>Any existing measures of success, <strong class="bold">key performance indicators</strong> (<strong class="bold">KPIs</strong>), or <strong class="bold">objectives and key results</strong> (<strong class="bold">OKRs</strong>) in support of key deliverables for <span class="No-Break">each stakeholder</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>After you have these items <a id="_idIndexMarker102"/>gathered, you can start to build out the map with the details, starting first with <span class="No-Break">a template.</span></p>
			<h3>Building the map</h3>
			<p>Next, build a template for this exercise. Any simple table can support this. I’ve seen great stakeholder maps built into a presentation, in a spreadsheet, or on virtual whiteboarding software. The format is less important than the content, so be flexible with the means and focus on the end result. If your team has a preference, <span class="No-Break">lean in.</span></p>
			<p>An example template could look <span class="No-Break">like this:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer017" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18846_02_01.jpg" alt="Figure 2.1 – Stakeholder map template"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.1 – Stakeholder map template</p>
			<p>As you work with your team and<a id="_idIndexMarker103"/> your stakeholder groups, you will begin to understand the stakeholder’s priorities in rank order of importance. You will then identify what you will do or what you have done to support that stakeholder and the target business results that your team has or <span class="No-Break">will deliver.</span></p>
			<p>An example for the sales division could look <span class="No-Break">like this:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer018" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18846_02_02.jpg" alt="Figure 2.2 – Stakeholder map example: sales division"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.2 – Stakeholder map example: sales division</p>
			<p>Once you have created the<a id="_idIndexMarker104"/> map, you will want to share and maintain the map with <span class="No-Break">your stakeholder.</span></p>
			<h3>Maintaining the map</h3>
			<p>As you work with the <strong class="bold">chief revenue officer</strong> (<strong class="bold">CRO</strong>) or head of sales, use this format or one like it to anchor your<a id="_idIndexMarker105"/> ongoing one-on-one meetings. Ask the <span class="No-Break">following questions:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Have your priorities changed? Have any new <span class="No-Break">priorities emerged?</span></li>
				<li>Are these priorities still aligned with what you need from my team? Is there <span class="No-Break">anything missing?</span></li>
				<li>Do these solutions still meet your needs? Are there any additional features or capabilities that you would like <span class="No-Break">to see?</span></li>
				<li>Do these target business results make sense? Are they what you expect from us? Are they ambitious enough? <span class="No-Break">Not enough?</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Finally, as you deliver against these solutions, you can add a fifth column, for actual results. Then, you can ask a very important <span class="No-Break">follow-up question:</span></p>
			<p><em class="italic">Are we aligned on the measured business results? Do you agree that my team provided this impact on your </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">team’s success?</em></span></p>
			<p>If the answer is no, ask additional questions from a place of curiosity. A suggestion that has worked for me in the past: What isn’t sitting well or doesn’t make sense as written? Are you willing to dig into this with me? I’d really like to get this right for you. The reason this works well is it’s not defensive; it’s from a place of true partnership. You are showing your stakeholders that you are committed to getting this business result right, not just in the delivery but in the<a id="_idIndexMarker106"/> measured business result. Ideally, you want your stakeholders to tell others what you did to enable their team, and they need to believe it as much as <span class="No-Break">you do.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-48"><a id="_idTextAnchor047"/>The case for building trust in data</h2>
			<p>According to Gartner, “<em class="italic">only 23% of respondents to Gartner’s Fifth Annual CDO Survey indicated that they defined and tracked metrics to measure the value delivered by data and analytics to stakeholder outcomes.</em>” (<em class="italic">Tie Your Data and Analytics Initiatives to Stakeholders and Their Business Goals</em>, published June 9, 2020, Gartner.) I see this day<a id="_idIndexMarker107"/> after day both inside the companies I have worked in and for peers. Most commonly, I see measurements that are about the <span class="No-Break">immediate stakeholder:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer019" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18846_02_03.jpg" alt="Figure 2.3 – Value chain to immediate stakeholder"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.3 – Value chain to immediate stakeholder</p>
			<p>For what it’s worth, you’re not alone. Data teams across industries and information technology teams both struggle with telling the ultimate value story. There are what I would call “traditional” data value metrics that matter for your data team. Data teams must go beyond basic metrics (that is, the percentage of improvement in data quality) and dive into <span class="No-Break">stakeholder-impacting metrics.</span></p>
			<p>For example, when delivering a propensity-to-buy model (that is, the likelihood of a customer buying a specific product), a data team often measures the time savings they created for the organization<a id="_idIndexMarker108"/> by implementing the model, meaning how much time was saved by the business from calculating the model manually, versus implementing an <strong class="bold">artificial intelligence</strong> (<strong class="bold">AI</strong>)/<strong class="bold">machine learning</strong> (<strong class="bold">ML</strong>)-driven model produced by the CDAO office’s data science team. While this measure of success is a strong one (time savings of manual work versus model use almost always results in a positive investment story), it is not the ultimate measure of success. The account executive within the sales team is recommending more appropriate solutions based on the model created by the CDAO team. This real-life example provides the end customer with a <span class="No-Break">felt impact.</span></p>
			<p>Unfortunately, when data teams focus on their first-degree stakeholder (sales operations) we fail to see the ultimate impact of our work (sales teams and the customer), and lose out on <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Measurement of the value added to <span class="No-Break">the enterprise</span><ul><li><span class="No-Break">Increased revenue</span></li><li><span class="No-Break">Time savings</span></li><li>Increased <span class="No-Break">customer value</span></li></ul></li>
				<li>Critical feedback loops from <span class="No-Break">end users</span><ul><li><span class="No-Break">Sales teams</span></li><li><span class="No-Break">Customers</span></li></ul></li>
				<li>Customer intimacy required to drive solutions <span class="No-Break">that matter</span><ul><li>Better measurement of buying behavior and ultimately <span class="No-Break">increase sales</span></li><li><span class="No-Break">Better recommendations</span></li><li>More <span class="No-Break">relevant sales</span></li><li>Increased <span class="No-Break">customer satisfaction</span></li><li>Lower churn <span class="No-Break">rate/customer attrition</span></li></ul></li>
			</ol>
			<p>To capture the full breadth <a id="_idIndexMarker109"/>of the impact, you must work more broadly, and work towards the ultimate stakeholder, as <span class="No-Break">depicted below:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer020" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18846_02_04.jpg" alt="Figure 2.4 – Value chain from data office to business and to customer"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.4 – Value chain from data office to business and to customer</p>
			<p>In reality, the impact is<a id="_idIndexMarker110"/> much more significant. You should measure more specifically by determining <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>How much did <span class="No-Break">revenue increase?</span></li>
				<li>How much productivity did the sales team save, by being able to rely on <span class="No-Break">this model?</span></li>
				<li>How much did customer satisfaction scores shift by being sold products that they <span class="No-Break">actually want?</span></li>
				<li>How much did customer <span class="No-Break">trust increase?</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Nearly every company fails to translate this into tangible, measurable, customer-impacting results. <em class="italic">What will the business gain?</em> <em class="italic">Why do it?</em> <em class="italic">Who benefits?</em> <em class="italic">By how much?</em> <em class="italic">Why?</em> <em class="italic">Who cares?</em> Success for <a id="_idIndexMarker111"/>CDAOs must be tied to stakeholders’ strategic, critical priorities. This mindset will help you as you work towards securing an <span class="No-Break">executive sponsor.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-49"><a id="_idTextAnchor048"/>Landing an executive sponsor</h1>
			<p>Before you begin to deliver wide-scale initiatives, you must identify and secure an executive sponsor. An executive <a id="_idIndexMarker112"/>sponsor is a single individual who will be providing top-down support for your program. Over the next several pages, I will share how to identify an executive sponsor, what makes a great sponsor, who else needs to support you, and finally, how to bring the entire company along on <span class="No-Break">the journey.</span></p>
			<p>To gather support, the most effective place to start is from the top down in your organization. Ideally, you should seek to obtain full support from the entire C-suite. However, you do need at least one (ideally at least two) C-suite member(s) who will serve as your executive sponsor(s). Executive sponsors differ from other executives in that they will be more hands-on in your overall data governance work and should help you navigate gaining support across the organization, including obtaining funding. If you are new to your organization, executive sponsors may also help you understand how to navigate the organization, what underlying politics may exist, and identify who makes investment decisions, and ultimately, <span class="No-Break">prioritization decisions.</span></p>
			<p>Without an executive sponsor, gaining momentum and funding may be much harder. In my first few data transformations, I personally experienced much stronger headwinds when we did not obtain the support of the right executives at the right time. While we ultimately ended up with a program that achieved our goals, it took much longer to gain momentum and support. This ultimately had a cascading effect on our ability to make measurable <span class="No-Break">progress quickly.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-50"><a id="_idTextAnchor049"/>Identifying and assessing sponsors</h2>
			<p>One of the best ways to identify an executive sponsor is to find an executive who has data governance needs that are <a id="_idIndexMarker113"/>preventing their success from coming to fruition. In <a href="B18846_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></span></a>, we discussed conducting deep listening sessions to identify needs across<a id="_idIndexMarker114"/> the organization. Now that you have those needs identified, thoroughly review which executive leaders have the most significant and urgent needs that you can solve with data governance solutions. The result is your best possible <span class="No-Break">executive sponsor.</span></p>
			<h3>Why business sponsors make the best sponsors</h3>
			<p>When it comes to finding a sponsor for <a id="_idIndexMarker115"/>data transformation, your best bet is to find a highly motivated business sponsor. Business sponsors are motivated because they have business needs. It sounds simple, but it is a simple driver that is often overlooked. The first thing to do is to evaluate their business strategy and identify opportunities for you to drive results for them within their business strategy through <span class="No-Break">data solutions.</span></p>
			<p>In the preceding section, I shared how to rethink how to identify the ultimate impact of your results. The ultimate internal stakeholder group (meaning the group you impact with your future delivery) makes the best candidates because they see, feel, and can measure the results of your data solutions. We will get into how to measure results more specifically in <a href="B18846_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor110"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Use case – technology company</p>
			<p class="callout">In one of my first roles in data, I had a big adjustment: learning to position a data solution without a regulatory driver. Although regulation can feel like a burden, it can also be helpful in driving change. During one of my earlier data transformations, I had to learn to position a data investment based on business <span class="No-Break">needs exclusively.</span></p>
			<p class="callout">Previously, I had been in the role of driving regulatory compliance, which required specific data solutions to be implemented. In this new role, I had to identify (clearly) what the business needed, why they needed it, and how I would measure success, and I had to do this all prior to <span class="No-Break">securing funding.</span></p>
			<p class="callout">While the solution was consistent (<strong class="bold">Master Data Management</strong> (<strong class="bold">MDM</strong>) platform), the positioning was completely different. In the technology company, I worked closely with the marketing division and <strong class="bold">Chief Marketing Officer</strong> (<strong class="bold">CMO</strong>) to define how we would master contact information for leads and what an improvement in master data contacts would mean for their business success. Therefore, the CMO became one of the business sponsors for the program. Additionally, we identified cost savings, and as a result, the <strong class="bold">Chief Accounting Officer</strong> (<strong class="bold">CAO</strong>) served as the other sponsor. Together, we proposed a solution, secured funding, and measured ongoing success throughout a 12-month <span class="No-Break">delivery timeline.</span></p>
			<p>Once you’ve identified <a id="_idIndexMarker116"/>opportunities to drive business results for your potential business sponsor, you should sit down with them and explain in business terms what data solutions you can deliver to help them achieve business success. You will need to articulate what you will do, how you will deliver it, what it will cost, how long it will take, how you will measure success, and the outcome that they will realize in business terms. We will spend more time in <a href="B18846_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor110"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></span></a> articulating how to craft <span class="No-Break">these measurements.</span></p>
			<p>Ultimately, <strong class="bold">business sponsors</strong> who believe you will drive business results for them will sponsor you. They have significant business needs, and when you help them win, you win. Additionally, when you drive success for them, they will tell your success story. The best success is one that your stakeholder tells on your behalf, so you should ensure they are fully bought into your delivery and that you empower them with outstanding results worth <span class="No-Break">bragging about.</span></p>

							<p>For example, if you improve the quality of your contact data, as in the preceding use case, it’s far more valuable to articulate what the business was able to do because the quality of the contact data improved.

What it translated to was a higher-quality pipeline, which had a measurable impact on marketable contacts <em class="italic">and</em> a measurable increase in sales.

			<h3>Why your sponsor is not your CIO</h3>
			<p>A common mistake in alignment in many organizations (irrespective of industry) is for the <strong class="bold">Chief Information Officer</strong> (<strong class="bold">CIO</strong>) to become the<a id="_idIndexMarker117"/> de facto sponsor for the CDAO and data governance programs. There are four clear reasons why your CIO cannot be your <span class="No-Break">primary sponsor:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Your CIO is <span class="No-Break">your partner.</span></li>
				<li>Your CIO is your <span class="No-Break">enablement team.</span></li>
				<li>Your CIO may be working <span class="No-Break">against you.</span></li>
				<li>Your CIO has their own challenges with <span class="No-Break">the business.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The primary reason why your sponsor is not your CIO is simple: your CIO is your delivery partner. They are one of your most critical partnerships in the entire organization, but not as a sponsor. Both a CDAO and a CIO have a common sponsor: the business. The very best sponsors are the businesses that you serve, together. Your CIO is there to enable you. When it comes to implementing the technology behind your data solutions, your CIO is there to help you be successful. Additionally, the CIO is there to enable your businesses to be successful. This is why you may also run into challenges with your CIO. They may have an incentive to deliver directly for the business instead of <span class="No-Break">for you.</span></p>
			<p>Unfortunately, you may find that their CIO could be actually working against you, because of this dynamic. If it comes down to prioritization, your CIO may be biased to deliver directly to the business instead of for you in service of the business. This is why it’s critical that the CIO works with you to prioritize appropriately with the business to ensure alignment enterprise-wide. Ideally, the CDAO, the CIO, and the business would sit down together to prioritize and align on priorities, measurable outcomes, and a plan for how to resolve issues when <span class="No-Break">they arise.</span></p>

							<p>While the CIO is <em class="italic">not</em> the most effective place for a CDO to report to, it is one of the more common structures.

			<h3>Characteristics of a great sponsor</h3>
			<p>If not the CIO, who should be your sponsor? The answer is the business leader who believes in you. So, how do you identify a great sponsor? It comes down to a few <span class="No-Break">key factors:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">They challenge you</strong>: A great sponsor will challenge you in many ways, but primarily, they will challenge you to define<a id="_idIndexMarker118"/> success in business terms that matter to them. You will be required to define the problem you are solving, not only in data terms but in business results that impact the business as <span class="No-Break">a whole.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">They force you to dig deeper</strong>: When you propose solutions, they will challenge you to make your business case stronger, more relevant, and aligned with corporate strategy in ways you wouldn’t or couldn’t see <span class="No-Break">for yourself.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">They define ultimate impact</strong>: Your sponsor should have a well-established reputation for defining success in terms of the ultimate impact on the success of the company. They should help you to understand how to position the impact of your solutions in a manner that the company will understand so that you can communicate the ultimate impact of your solutions in a way that is culturally appropriate and will <span class="No-Break">garner support.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">They have CEO sponsorship</strong>: The best sponsors are aligned with and supported by <span class="No-Break">the CEO.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">They are on the C-suite</strong>: The sponsor you select needs to be a direct report to the CEO to ensure adequate sponsorship at the top of the organization and to ensure the CEO is involved in conversations about <span class="No-Break">data governance.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now that we’ve covered what makes a good sponsor, let’s dig into how to build a great business case to help secure the sponsor <span class="No-Break">you desire.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-51"><a id="_idTextAnchor050"/>Building a business case to land a sponsor</h2>
			<p>As you deeply listen to your stakeholders, including your potential executive sponsor, this is the time to take all of those problems and needs that they share with you and craft them into a business case for <a id="_idIndexMarker119"/>your program. I would recommend you start with the executive sponsor’s area of responsibility and define this as one of your key focus areas (that is, data domains). This data domain can become your pilot that will allow you to draft your enterprise data strategy and simultaneously deliver on a data <span class="No-Break">domain’s needs.</span></p>
			<h3>Key components</h3>
			<p>Key components of a strong business <a id="_idIndexMarker120"/>case include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Value proposition/objective</span></li>
				<li>Business outcomes that are specific <span class="No-Break">and measurable</span></li>
				<li>Value chain creation to demonstrate where and when you will <span class="No-Break">deliver value</span></li>
				<li>Timelines and <span class="No-Break">key milestones</span></li>
				<li>Key partners, roles, and structures required to <span class="No-Break">support delivery</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>There are several pros to this approach, which include being able to demonstrate delivery of meaningful business-valued solutions, securing quick and meaningful wins, and being able to adjust your enterprise data strategy iteratively as you deliver for this data domain. By focusing on this domain, you are able to balance learning the ways the organization operates, developing meaningful feedback loops for your solutions to deliver iteratively better, and you can build trust with your presumed executive sponsor so that they feel confident standing behind you in delivering enterprise-wide <span class="No-Break">data governance.</span></p>
			<p>Depending on the size, scale, and quality of your team, you may be able to launch a second domain and deliver for your secondary executive sponsor (we will talk about the team in <a href="B18846_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor057"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></span></a>). However, it is far better to execute with quality in one area than in multiple areas with anything less than high-quality results. This is even more important when you are new to an organization and are working to establish your personal brand and credibility and working to align the company behind your strategy. Be cautious about overpromising and under-delivering. This is the fastest path to exit a <span class="No-Break">company quickly.</span></p>
			<p>CDOs have alarmingly short tenures. According to <em class="italic">Harvard Business Review</em>, the reason the CDO role churns so quickly is a combination of high expectations and low ability to deliver, given the <a id="_idIndexMarker121"/>complexity of the challenge ahead of them. Further, they are in high demand, making experienced CDOs a target for external recruiting. Having worked in three <em class="italic">Fortune 500</em> organizations, I can attest to having personally witnessed a high turnover rate for the CDOs I have worked with, and as a <span class="No-Break">CDO myself.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Key learning</p>
			<p class="callout">The objective here is to optimize for impact and timeline. High impact, delivered too slowly, and the CDO will run out of time to make a difference before the expectations of their performance fade. Low impact delivered quickly, and the credibility of the CDO is in question. The goal here is to find a high-impact area where you can make quick and visible progress. <span class="No-Break">Choose wisely.</span></p>
			<p>The business-case format matters far less than the content. I have seen great business cases exist in slide presentations, as documents or memos, and be recordings or videos. The most important part is the information contained within the business case. Working closely with your executive sponsor and their direct team members, you should craft a very powerful <em class="italic">why</em> statement. Why do you need to deliver the data capabilities included? What will you do? What will the results be? And, finally, what will be different in terms of the business once the capabilities are implemented? Your business results are not “implemented a data catalog;” they are very specific to what the business can do once the data catalog is implemented. It may be most important that the company standardizes on common business terms enterprise-wide. The outcome is aligned business terminology; the capability is the data catalog. This delineation is critical to <span class="No-Break">your success.</span></p>
			<p>Finally, I recommend your business case is kept evergreen. As you learn and deliver, do not be afraid to come back to your original business case and make edits based on what you learn throughout your journey. The executive sponsor should be willing and able to spend the time needed to ensure complete alignment of the business case content prior to any launch. I recommend you start by aligning the executive sponsor’s direct reports first, and then when you go to the executive sponsor for final sign-off, you have already obtained the alignment of <span class="No-Break">their team.</span></p>
			<p>A very successful business case I wrote was structured as an approximately 10-page memo that was built by my enterprise data team, with inputs from sales operations, sales, marketing, operations, IT, and legal/compliance. The business case was built over approximately 10-12 weeks <a id="_idIndexMarker122"/>and ultimately presented to our transformation committee for funding and approval. The format is of lesser importance than the content, but what worked well in this example was <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>

			<p>For each quarterly update to the committee, we returned to this format and simply updated it to reflect the progress and any wins beyond what we committed to, as well as any misses. We clearly articulated how far we were in delivering against our KPIs/OKRs and revised<a id="_idIndexMarker124"/> transparently and openly when we needed to adjust. In driving our program in this manner, we set a precedent not just for how data can be measured in terms of value but also in how seemingly “difficult to measure” programs can, in fact, measure results in terms the business can understand. It put credibility into the data team and was one of the biggest changes I made: that of trust <span class="No-Break">in data.</span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-52"><a id="_idTextAnchor051"/>A note on translating to business outcomes</h2>
			<p>To be successful, you must translate your work into business outcomes. Because of the importance of this component, and that in my<a id="_idIndexMarker125"/> experience, it is the reason a CDAO succeeds or fails, we will spend an entire chapter on this topic to ensure you are empowered with all the information you need to craft meaningful business outcomes for your success and that of your team. <a href="B18846_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor110"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></span></a> will focus on this <span class="No-Break">topic exclusively.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-53"><a id="_idTextAnchor052"/>Establishing feedback loops</h1>
			<p>As you deliver the right capabilities for your executive sponsor, it is critical that you continue to meet with them during your delivery. Since you should be creating the enterprise data strategy while you are delivering for your executive sponsor’s domain, you should hold at least quarterly <a id="_idIndexMarker126"/>enterprise data committee meetings to share progress, prioritize additional needs of the company, and garner additional support from the rest of the domain leaders. One of the biggest mistakes you can make is meeting at the wrong frequency. There are two extremes <span class="No-Break">to consider:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Meeting too often, without meaningful updates or progress <span class="No-Break">to share</span></li>
				<li>Meeting too infrequently, and the committee does not remember what you committed to deliver and <span class="No-Break">loses interest</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>It is your job to find the right audience and the right frequency to match your enterprise needs. I recommend quarterly meetings at first unless there is a great deal of urgency (for example, regulatory commitment, sanction, or another crisis). You can adjust as the members of the committee desire. Ask for feedback and continue to adjust <span class="No-Break">as needed.</span></p>
			<p>There are a few signs to watch for which indicate you might be on the wrong pacing for meeting with your enterprise data committee and <span class="No-Break">executive sponsors:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong class="bold">Your membership shifts</strong>: If you find that your meeting starts to get delegated to lower levels of the organization, this is a signal that your members are not finding your meetings meaningful and have pushed them to their <span class="No-Break">team members.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">You get requests for off-cycle meetings</strong>: If you find that your members are asking for information off-cycle or in between meetings, you may need to meet <span class="No-Break">more frequently.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">There is silence</strong>: If you find there is little to no participation or no questions off-cycle at all, you may not be providing relevant information, or your members may not understand what you are trying to communicate <span class="No-Break">with them.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>If any of these (or all) are true, I recommend you ask for feedback as soon as possible from your committee members. These are all signs you need to make changes regarding the frequency and/or content you are sharing with the group. If the membership has shifted, you may need to do a<a id="_idIndexMarker127"/> series of 1:1 meetings with your members to re-engage them and ask them to return to future cycles of the meeting. You likely have one additional chance to re-engage them before they stop coming <span class="No-Break">for good.</span></p>
			<p>Assuming all is going well with your pilot data domain and executive sponsor, you may be able to launch a second data domain on a slightly staggered start date. A word of caution: do not start a second data domain unless you are very confident you have strong support from the company <em class="italic">and</em> the delivery of the first data domain is going very well. Even then, it is critical that you maximize quality over quantity. It is far better to execute well with one domain than to deliver against two with <span class="No-Break">mediocre results.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-54"><a id="_idTextAnchor053"/>Key roles to support you</h1>
			<p>As a part of your delivery plan, for your first data domain, I recommend you spend the appropriate time aligning on roles and responsibilities between your team (the business of data), the technology team (the technology of data), and the business team (the data domain). This can be accomplished by working with the executive data domain leader’s team, the CIO (or their delegate), and your team. Working together to define what you are responsible for versus what the data domain is responsible for versus what the IT function is responsible for upfront will enable better teamwork as you get into <span class="No-Break">delivery together.</span></p>
			<p>You will also need to establish a strong relationship with your finance business partner to assist you in managing the appropriate budget for your program, as well as the talent team (sometimes referred to as HR or recruitment) as you build out your team, which I will describe in <a href="B18846_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor057"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></span></a> in more detail. There are various other functions that you may need to engage with depending on the size and scale of your own organization. Regardless of size and complexity, I recommend identifying all the parties you need involved and what you need from them or what they may need from you throughout <span class="No-Break">your program:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">CIO</strong>: While they are not your executive sponsor, they are a critical member of your support team. The CIO is critical to your success because their team will ensure you have appropriate systems<a id="_idIndexMarker128"/> and tools, as well as engineering staff, to drive the implementation of platforms and data management tooling and ensure your solutions have adequate infrastructure to successfully deliver on <span class="No-Break">your commitments.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Chief financial officer (CFO)</strong>: The CFO makes an excellent supporting/secondary sponsor but is also the supporter you need to secure funding. It’s paramount that you bring <a id="_idIndexMarker129"/>your CFO along on your journey, explaining what you are proposing, the value (in decreased costs, decreased/managed risks, increased revenue, time savings, and so on), and key timelines. They will be able to help you navigate how to secure funding, who needs to support you, and what their role will be in <span class="No-Break">allocating funding.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">General counsel/chief privacy officer (CPO)/chief information security officer (CISO)</strong>: These key roles will be outstanding partners for you in driving requirements (that is, must-do <a id="_idIndexMarker130"/>activities to maintain legal and security <a id="_idIndexMarker131"/>protections for the company). They serve as independent and excellent supporters because they need you. For example, these three leaders must know what data the company has, where it is located, and how it is classified so that they can adequately protect it. Between these three leaders, you will need to develop a comprehensive list of requirements to support the legal needs of the company and what is required to secure the <span class="No-Break">company’s data.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Chief people officer (CPO)/head of HR</strong>: Your CPO or head of HR is another critical partner in your success. This leader will help you structure and hire your team, re-organize team members into your function from other parts of the business, and build ongoing talent <a id="_idIndexMarker132"/>management support. Often, they will assign an HR business partner to align with your organization. Work with this leader directly, but occasionally stay connected with the CPO to ensure they are fully aware of what is working well and how your team’s priorities are progressing. They can help you identify key talent in the broader company looking for new challenges that may be a great fit for <span class="No-Break">your team.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Business leaders</strong>: Business leaders run divisions of the company and are your ultimate stakeholders. What you deliver for the company is to enable them to achieve results. You should build <a id="_idIndexMarker133"/>strong relationships with each business leader, as described previously. Further, ensure you are reporting progress back to them by showing them results your team drove for the entirety of the business. You need their vocal support for your program. In some companies, business leaders can also allocate a budget to support <span class="No-Break">your efforts.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Your executive sponsor should sponsor you to present early and regularly at your company’s most executive forum. Some companies refer to this group as the C-suite, the executive leadership team, or perhaps e-Staff (for executive staff). It may contain only the CEO’s direct reports or it may include additional roles, depending on the CEO’s preferences. I recommend having your executive sponsor set the stage for you, explaining why they have decided to play a role in your success and what value they believe you can bring, and endorse your program before they introduce you. This will grab the audience’s attention so that they are focused on your presentation. Return to the forum regularly to share wins, adjustments, and impacts that <span class="No-Break">you achieve.</span></p>
			<p>The executive leadership team may also want you to present at the Board of Directors meetings, depending on the state of data at your organization and the importance of the issue. I highly recommend presenting to your board if the opportunity is presented. They can be incredible supporters and can ensure the CEO supports you. As a board member myself, I often ask questions about data presented in board packets and that management is using <span class="No-Break">for decision-making.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-55"><a id="_idTextAnchor054"/>How to gain the support of the masses</h1>
			<p>With the amount of data doubling by 2026 and the increased demand for a trust-based approach, it’s critical we approach building our programs through that same lens: one where trust comes first. To build trust with the entirety of the organization, you need to show them they can trust you through your delivery. We previously discussed the importance of the enterprise data committee, which is critical for executive support. In addition, you should create<a id="_idIndexMarker134"/> forums and communication mechanisms to keep excitement and energy up about what you are doing to transform <span class="No-Break">the company.</span></p>
			<p>I recommend setting up a forum that does not have a restriction on the “who” or “how many” people attend. A broad and open forum is a great place to show what has been done versus telling what has been done. As you build capabilities, providing a demonstration as to what has been delivered and how the masses can start to take advantage and use the capabilities is how you will start to show your delivery and gain trust. Remember – you do not gain trust by talking about what you will do; you gain trust by showing what you did. Trust is built on actions, <span class="No-Break">not talk.</span></p>
			<p>Anchor your communications on a very basic model: What will the average employee be able to do upon delivery that they can’t do today? Why does that matter? The answers to these two basic questions are your message. Be clear about this, specific, and with a strong bias for their lived experience in <span class="No-Break">your company.</span></p>
			<p>Make your progress transparent. Use internal wikis, electronic newsletters, and even short video clips to tell the masses what is happening and how delivery is progressing. Using a tool such as Confluence® to post key information about your transformation (such as your business case!), the roadmap, recent accomplishments, links to key artifacts (such as business requirements and technical requirements), as well as metrics will save you time in having to hold meetings every time someone has <span class="No-Break">a question.</span></p>
			<p>The preceding steps in which you bring together the power of a supportive executive sponsor, your enterprise data committee, and stakeholders enterprise-wide through forums and written communication is creating the energy that will carry you through the data governance transformation. It’s your responsibility and honor to unite the masses in this way. Very few programs have the ability or the interest to unite this broad community in the way<a id="_idIndexMarker135"/> you can, by building trust in data. The cornerstone of the entire coalition is relationships. Invest early and often to drive the results <span class="No-Break">you desire.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-56"><a id="_idTextAnchor055"/>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>Building a strong relationship with stakeholders is a critical component of any data leader’s success. As you think about building an entire network of supporters, be laser focused on which one or two would make the best sponsors. In this chapter I shared what makes a great sponsor, how to build a strong business case to secure a leader as your sponsor, and why a CIO is a great partner, but not your best selection for a sponsor. As a result of this chapter you should now be <span class="No-Break">able to:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Build relationships with the executive team and key roles at all levels of <span class="No-Break">the organization.</span></li>
				<li>Identify at least one, ideally two, <span class="No-Break">executive sponsor.</span></li>
				<li>Write a compelling business case for your executive sponsor’s <span class="No-Break">data domain.</span></li>
				<li>Establish feedback loops and <span class="No-Break">communication mechanisms.</span></li>
				<li>Communicate with the enterprise to gain the support of <span class="No-Break">the masses.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>As we pivot now into <a href="B18846_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor057"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></span></a>, where we walk through how to build a high performing team to drive success for your company, remember what your sponsor needs, and how you might build a great team to impact your sponsors desired outcomes. Chapters 2 and 3 can be executed concurrently, and both topics take time to complete. The best time to get started on both, is <span class="No-Break">right now.</span></p>
