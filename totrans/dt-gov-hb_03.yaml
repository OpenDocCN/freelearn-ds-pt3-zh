    investment in the success of the company’s use of data. By reading this chapter,
    I assume you are looking to build a high-performing data governance team and/or
    create an entire data and analytics function. Ultimately, your success will depend
    on the team you assemble to deliver excellent, high-quality impactful solutions
    for your organization. Given the scarcity of talented data professionals, this
    is the second most critical indicator of your success; that is, hiring the best
    possible talent you can afford for your company (the first being able to set and
    measure what success is, as I covered in [*Chapter 2*](B18846_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor041),
    *How to Build a Coalition of Advocates* and [*Chapter 5*](B18846_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor110),

    scenarios that have led to your need to build a team. You might be the first hire
    for data and have to build an entire team from scratch. You could have been brought
    in to bring together disparate teams across your company to unify them under your
    leadership. Or, you could have inherited an entirely intact existing team in need
    of a transformation. No matter which situation you find yourself in, the performance
    of the team sits firmly on your shoulders from the moment you walk in the door.

    the team for success, how to implement the right routines and rhythms, and how
    to grow talent both within your team and across your company. As you might have
    assumed, establishing a high-performing data governance team is a critical and
    long-term investment in the success of the company’s use of data. **Chief Data
    and Analytics Officers** (**CDAOs**) and offices of the CDAO only began to be
    established in 2002 (first, at *Capital One*), and as recently as 2012, only 100
    CDAOs existed globally. However, in the last few years, the number of CDAOs has
    grown to over 152,000, according to *LinkedIn* data. The role of **Chief Data
    Officer** (**CDO**) is much more common, with 67.9% of major companies reported
    to have appointed a CDO, up from 12% in 2012\. With demand for CDAO roles emerging
    at a rapid pace and the salary of these specialists rising to match demand, the
    **return on investment** (**ROI**) of these roles is under constant scrutiny.
    It is critical for the success of the office of the CDAO to build a high-performing
    team quickly, efficiently, and with effective measures of value.

    office of the CDO. Depending on your organizational structure selected, you may
    have a larger size and scoped office or a smaller size and scoped office. Ideally,
    this central office of the CDO will be responsible for setting the expectations,
    policies, and standards that the organization will adhere to. At a minimum, the
    central function will own the responsibility for setting these requirements and
    should also be responsible for implementation and ongoing monitoring of compliance.

    data is managed as a company. If an organization wants to manage data well, it
    must establish this central group at a bare minimum. To maintain objectivity and
    remove bias in the policies and monitoring practices established by the office

    be responsible for both data management and data analytics, whereas, in other
    organizations, a CDO may only have responsibilities for data management. I have
    been a CDO in both definitions. Less commonly, a **chief analytics officer** (**CAO**)
    may also be established. The title is less important between CDO or CDAO than
    a definition and clarity of the responsibilities of the role. What’s important
    is to know in terms of what your organization refers to as the top data leader
    is what their scope of responsibility includes and that BUs and corporate functions

    the team in this book, I do want to spend just a moment on the analytics side
    of the team structure. Candidly, I believe there are an infinite number of ways
    to structure the analytics side of the house, as you can read further in John
    K. Thompson’s book, *Building Analytics Teams* (an excellent book for anyone looking
    to drive excellence in analytics). There are a few ways to optimize analytics
    that I have leveraged in my own teams. In all cases, it is based on the business
    outcome I have been aiming to optimize for.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, if you are internally focused, aimed at driving operational excellence,
    aligning top-of-the-house metrics, or simply supporting internal operational functions,
    a simple single team may be your best bet. I have consolidated analytics teams
    under a single analytics leader in cases where we are optimizing for the company’s
    internal needs. Second, if you are focused on improving products and engineering
    therein, I would recommend aligning the analytics teams by BU. For example, if
    you have a software and a hardware BU, divide your analytics team into a software
    analytics team and a hardware analytics team. The upside is your teams are now
    intensely focused and aligned with the business area they support, learn the drivers
    deeply, and can optimize for their stakeholders. The downside is you must personally
    be the connective tissue across these two teams and ensure alignment, as well
    as where the two teams need to come together for success.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Alternatively, depending on your business, you may also be intensely focused
    on the customer (and I hope that you are, regardless of business). This focus
    on external stakeholders (marketing, sales, customer success) may result in individual
    analytics teams for sales, marketing, and CXS, or a single team focused on customer
    analytics. In all cases, you should optimize for the outcomes you are aiming to
    solve and not be afraid to adjust as your priorities change. When you stand up
    your team, you may have burning needs that must be addressed urgently; optimize

    the rhythm of the business of data. In all of the data programs I have led, I
    have underappreciated the importance of this early on and have had to learn from
    the consequences. While you are coming into your role and listening to the business,
    your team, and working on your strategy, your team is still working on…something.
    It is critical that you get your arms around what is happening within your team
    while you are working with your peers and senior executives to understand the
    priorities of the company and for the future of your team.

    of the programs, projects, and **business-as-usual** (**BAU**) work that is occurring
    across your organization. A program leader or chief of staff is a great person
    to tap into to lead this effort. In my experience, program management is often
    not the priority of data leaders, and thus, I have yet to step into a data leadership
    role where this existed clearly and comprehensively. If you have this in your
    team, you are off to a great start. If you don’t, get to work on identifying what
    the team is working on, and do it quickly. The sooner you can get your arms around
    the outcomes the team is already working on, the sooner you can identify quick
    wins and optimize the team for success.

    from the work of your team), issues and risks, and upcoming milestones. Does the
    team need your support to move forward? Are there barriers to success? This insight
    will also help arm you headed into executive stakeholder meetings so that you
    are not caught off guard as you are working to form relationships. You may want
    to establish a business of data program review for this purpose, on at least a
    bi-weekly basis. As you are getting up to speed in your role, you may ask each
    of your direct reports to set up a time to brief you more comprehensively on their
    portions of the program so that you can get a deeper dive before moving into the

    Utilizing terms such as “data trustee” or “steward” drives behaviors that the

    for the use of others. This is a very different mindset than that of “ownership,”
    which implies an environment where there is no sharing. The sole purpose of data
    management is to care for data and to use it for its intended value. Ownership
    creates barriers to achieving this purpose and thus is not recommended. Data is
    an enterprise asset and should be treated as such. The stewards are in place to

    but also with the business. Consider rotating your team members out into the businesses
    they support (along with someone from the business coming into your team) for
    a period of time agreed to with the business. Do you risk losing your team members
    permanently in the business? Yes – however, this may also place more data-literate
    individuals into the business who can become champions for your team and the work
    you do. This is still a good outcome if you allow it to be. Ideally, that individual
    comes back to your team with a renewed perspective of the business they support.

    need a 4-year college degree to qualify? Or is 4 years of on-the-job training
    sufficient? What about a 2-year associate’s degree? Do you accept certifications?
    What is it that you are attempting to obtain from a skills perspective from the
    requirements you outline? I am not discounting a college education; however, there
    may be roles where you can widen your aperture and tap into an entirely new population
    of candidates that you would not otherwise have considered.

    For example, the business of data program leader defined previously could be hired
    and trained from your company’s **project management office** (**PMO**). Perhaps
    they have been exposed to your team and could bring rigor from the PMO team to
    your organization. Overall, thinking beyond traditional hiring criteria may create
    a more diverse, innovative, and deeper talent pool than you may have originally
    considered.

    to set expectations with the team that you may need to evolve. The one constant
    is change, and with success will come the need to change, add team members, optimize,
    and restructure, and that’s a good thing. It means that you are making an impact.
    Pick the right model for you, adjust it for your company’s unique needs, and get
    going. The faster you make changes, based on the right information, the better
    off your team members will be, and the sooner they can focus on delivery.
