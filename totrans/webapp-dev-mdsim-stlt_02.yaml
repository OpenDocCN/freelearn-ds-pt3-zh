    Setting up a Python coding environment, especially in Linux (for example, Ubuntu),
    can be done in a few simple steps: update (or install) Python, install a code
    editor or IDE (maybe something free, such as **Sublime Text**), set up a virtual
    environment (in the book, we are using **pipenv**, but any other would be good),
    and install dependencies. After these steps, we should have a fully functional
    Python coding environment (in Ubuntu or any other **operating system** (**OS**))
    that’s ready to use for our web application’s development.'

    tools needed to make our developments with Streamlit smooth and productive. So,
    first of all, we are dealing with the choice of OS, which can be real or virtual,
    and either Windows, macOS, or Linux (our preferred solution). Next, we have to
    decide what kind of editor or **integrated development environment** (**IDE**)
    to use for coding. Some of them are very advanced and expensive, and some others
    are a little bit simpler but free. Finally, we’ll talk about virtual environments
    and the advantages of using them.

    the place where everything is supposed to run. Even if the first choice we are
    asked to make is in regard to the OS to be used, we can say that from this point
    of view, we are lucky, because Streamlit is a framework in Python. This programming
    language works more or less on any OS, so we are really free to select what we
    want – for example, macOS, Windows, any Linux distribution, or, if you like, even
    any BSD flavor.

    don’t need to install it on your machine as an exclusive and unique OS as you
    can use virtualization software, a very useful tool that makes it possible to
    run an OS inside another OS! Moreover, knowing how to manage a virtualization
    tool and install on it any kind of OS can be a very useful skill for the future!

    how to create a developing environment while keeping costs very low (almost free).
    So, we decided to use Ubuntu as our main OS. After that, we made sure to have
    Python already available and installed `pip`. The selection of the IDE was quite
    straightforward since we chose Sublime Text, a quite light, powerful, and advanced
    text editor.

    was `pipenv` because it is quite powerful, easy to use, and full of advanced features.
    We spent some time on a quite complete overview of this tool and its main features
    and instructions.
