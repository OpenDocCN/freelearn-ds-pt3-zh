			<h1 id="_idParaDest-16"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor015"/>Chapter 1</em>: Overview of the Dash Ecosystem</h1>
			<p>One of the few constants in our work with data is the amount of change in the volume, sources, and types of data that we deal with. Being able to quickly combine data from different sources and explore them is crucial. <strong class="bold">Dash</strong> is not only for exploring data; it can be used for almost all phases of the data analysis process, from exploration to operational production environments.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will get an overview of Dash's ecosystem and focus on building the layout, or the user-facing part, of the app. By the end of the chapter, you will be able to build a running app with almost any visual component you want, but without interactivity. </p>
			<p>The following topics will be covered:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Setting up your environment</li>
				<li>Exploring Dash and other supporting packages</li>
				<li>Understanding the general structure of a Dash app</li>
				<li>Creating and running the simplest app</li>
				<li>Adding HTML and other components to the app</li>
				<li>Learning how to structure the layout and managing themes</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-17"><a id="_idTextAnchor016"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>Every chapter will have slightly different requirements, but there are some that you will need throughout the book.</p>
			<p>You should have access to Python 3.6 or higher, which can be easily downloaded from <a href="https://www.python.org">https://www.python.org</a>, as well <a id="_idIndexMarker000"/>as a text editor or an <strong class="bold">integrated development environment</strong> (<strong class="bold">IDE</strong>) so you can edit code.</p>
			<p>For this chapter, we will be using <strong class="bold">Dash</strong>, <strong class="bold">Dash HTML Components</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Dash Bootstrap Components</strong>, which <a id="_idIndexMarker001"/>can be installed together <a id="_idIndexMarker002"/>with all other required packages by following the instructions in the following section. All code and data required for this book can be downloaded from the book's GitHub repository, which can be found at<span class="hidden"> </span><a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Interactive-Dashboards-and-Data-Apps-with-Plotly-and-Dash">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Interactive-Dashboards-and-Data-Apps-with-Plotly-and-Dash</a>. As I just mentioned, the following section will show in detail how to get started with your setup.</p>
			<p>The code files of this chapter can be found on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Interactive-Dashboards-and-Data-Apps-with-Plotly-and-Dash/tree/master/chapter_01">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Interactive-Dashboards-and-Data-Apps-with-Plotly-and-Dash/tree/master/chapter_01</a>.</p>
			<p>Check out the following video to see the Code in Action at <a href="https://bit.ly/3atXPjc">https://bit.ly/3atXPjc</a>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-18"><a id="_idTextAnchor017"/>Setting up your environment</h1>
			<p>With the fast pace of change in all the packages used in the book, you will most likely come across <a id="_idIndexMarker003"/>some differences in functionality, so in order to reproduce the exact outcomes described in the book, you can clone the book's repository, install the packages used (in the specified versions), and use the included dataset. From the command line, go to a folder in which you want to build the project and do the following:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Create a Python virtual environment in a folder called <strong class="source-inline">dash_project</strong> (or any other name you want). This will also create a new folder with the name you chose:<p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">python3 –m venv dash_project</strong></p></li>
				<li>Activate the virtual environment.<p>On Unix or macOS, run this:</p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">source dash_project/bin/activate</strong></p><p>On Windows, run this:</p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">dash_project\Scripts\activate.bat</strong></p></li>
				<li>Go to the created folder:<p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">cd dash_project</strong></p></li>
				<li>Clone the book's GitHub repository:<p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">git clone</strong><strong class="bold">   https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Interactive-Dashboards-and-Data-Apps-with-Plotly-and-Dash </strong></p></li>
				<li>You should now have a file containing the required packages and their versions called <strong class="source-inline">requirements.txt</strong>. You can install those packages by going to the repository's folder and running the <strong class="source-inline">install</strong> command as follows:<p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">cd Interactive-Dashboards-and-Data-Apps-with-Plotly-and-Dash/</strong></p><p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">pip install -r requirements.txt</strong></p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>You should find a copy of the dataset in the <strong class="source-inline">data</strong> folder, which was downloaded from this link: <a href="https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/poverty-and-equity-database">https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/poverty-and-equity-database</a>. You can get the latest version if you want, but as with packages, if you want to get the same results, it's better to work with the provided dataset.</p>
			<p>In order <a id="_idIndexMarker004"/>for Plotly figures and apps to be displayed in <a id="_idIndexMarker005"/>JupyterLab, you will need to install Node.js, which can be install from <a href="https://nodejs.org">https://nodejs.org</a>.</p>
			<p>You will also need to install the JupyterLab Plotly extension, which can be done by running the following from the command line in your virtual environment:</p>
			<p class="source-code">jupyter labextension install jupyterlab-plotly@4.14.1</p>
			<p>Note that the version number at the end should correspond to the version of Plotly that you are running. You can replace the preceding version numbers if you want to upgrade (making sure to upgrade the Plotly Python package as well).</p>
			<p>Once you have run the preceding code, you should have everything you need to follow along. You will see that each chapter of this book builds on the previous one: we will be building an app that adds more and more functionality and complexity as we go through the chapters.</p>
			<p>The main objective is to put you in a practical setting as much as possible. In general, it is straightforward to create any standalone Dash component, but it gets more challenging when you already have a few components in a running app. This becomes clear when you have to decide how to change the layout to accommodate new changes and how to refactor code, focusing on the details without losing sight of the big picture.</p>
			<p>Now that the environment has been established, let's get an overview of Dash.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-19"><a id="_idTextAnchor018"/>Exploring Dash and other supporting packages</h1>
			<p>Although not <a id="_idIndexMarker006"/>strictly necessary, it's good to know the main components <a id="_idIndexMarker007"/>that are used to make Dash and its dependencies, especially for more advanced usage, and in order to know how and where to get more information:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer006" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16780_01_001.jpg" alt="Figure 1.1 – What Dash is made of"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.1 – What Dash is made of</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">One of the main advantages of using Dash is that it allows us to create fully interactive data, analytics, and web apps and interfaces, using pure Python, without having to worry about HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.</p>
			<p>As you can see in Figure 1.1, Dash uses <strong class="bold">Flask</strong> for the <a id="_idIndexMarker008"/>backend. For producing charts, it uses <strong class="bold">Plotly</strong>, although it <a id="_idIndexMarker009"/>is not strictly required, but it is the best-supported <a id="_idIndexMarker010"/>package for data visualization. <strong class="bold">React</strong> is used for handling all components, and actually a Dash app is rendered as a single-page React app. The most important things for us are the different packages that we will be using to create our app, which we will be covering next.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">For people who are familiar with or invested in learning Matplotlib, there is a special set of tools to convert Matplotlib figures to Plotly figures. Once you have created your figure in Matplotlib, you can convert it to Plotly with one command: <strong class="source-inline">mpl_to_plotly</strong>. As of the time of this writing, this is supported for Matplotlib&lt;=3.0.3 only. Here is a full example:</p>
			<p class="source-code">%config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina'</p>
			<p class="source-code">import matplotlib.pyplot as plt</p>
			<p class="source-code">from plotly.tools import mpl_to_plotly</p>
			<p class="source-code">mpl_fig, ax = plt.subplots()</p>
			<p class="source-code">ax.scatter(x=[1, 2, 3], y=[23, 12, 34])</p>
			<p class="source-code">plotly_fig = mpl_to_plotly(mpl_fig)</p>
			<p class="source-code">plotly_fig</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-20"><a id="_idTextAnchor019"/>The different packages that Dash contains</h2>
			<p>Dash is not <a id="_idIndexMarker011"/>one big package that contains everything. Instead, it consists of several packages, each handling a certain aspect. In addition, as we will see later, there are several third-party packages that are used, and the community is encouraged to develop their own functionality by creating special Dash packages.</p>
			<p>The following are the main packages that we will mostly be using in this chapter, and we will explore others in later chapters:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Dash</strong>: This is the <a id="_idIndexMarker012"/>main package, which provides the backbone <a id="_idIndexMarker013"/>of any app, through the <strong class="source-inline">dash.Dash</strong> object. It also provides a few other tools for managing interactivity and exceptions, which we will get into later as we build our app.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Dash Core Components</strong>: A package that provides a set of interactive components <a id="_idIndexMarker014"/>that can be manipulated by users. Dropdowns, date pickers, sliders, and many more components <a id="_idIndexMarker015"/>are included in this package. We will learn how to use them to manage reactivity in <a href="B16780_02_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor031"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Exploring the Structure of a Dash App</em>, and will be focusing on how to use them in detail in <em class="italic">Part 2</em> of the book.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Dash HTML Components</strong>: This package provides all the available HTML tags as Python <a id="_idIndexMarker016"/>classes. It simply converts Python to HTML. For <a id="_idIndexMarker017"/>example, you can write <strong class="source-inline">dash_html_components.H1('Hello, World')</strong> in Python, and it will be converted to <strong class="source-inline">&lt;h1&gt;Hello, World&lt;/h1&gt;</strong> and rendered as such in the browser.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Dash Bootstrap Components</strong>: This is a third-party package that adds Bootstrap <a id="_idIndexMarker018"/>functionality to Dash. This package <a id="_idIndexMarker019"/>and its components take care of a lot of options related to layouts and visual signals. Laying out elements side by side or on top of one another, specifying their sizes based on the browser's screen size, and providing a set of encoded colors for better communicating with users are some of the benefits of using it.<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p><p class="callout">The recommended way to install the main packages of Dash is to simply install Dash, and it will automatically handle installing the other packages, ensuring that they get installed with the correct versions. Simply run <strong class="source-inline">pip install dash</strong> from the command line. For upgrades, that would be <strong class="source-inline">pip install dash --upgrade</strong>.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>We will <a id="_idIndexMarker020"/>now take a brief look at the general structure of a typical Dash app, after which we will start coding.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-21"><a id="_idTextAnchor020"/>Understanding the general structure of a Dash app</h1>
			<p>The following <a id="_idIndexMarker021"/>diagram shows what generally goes into creating a Dash app. We typically <a id="_idIndexMarker022"/>have a file called <strong class="source-inline">app.py</strong>, although you can name it whatever you want. The file is shown as the column on the right, with the different parts split by lines, just to visually distinguish between them, while on the left is the name of each part:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer007" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16780_01_002.jpg" alt="Figure 1.2 – The structure of a Dash app"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.2 – The structure of a Dash app</p>
			<p>Let's look <a id="_idIndexMarker023"/>at each app part in detail:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Imports (boilerplate):</strong> Like any Python module, we begin by importing the required packages, using their usual aliases.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">App instantiation</strong>: A straightforward way to create the app, by creating the <strong class="source-inline">app</strong> variable in this case. The <strong class="source-inline">__name__</strong> value for the <strong class="source-inline">name</strong> parameter is used to make it easy for Dash to locate static assets to be used in the app.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">App layout</strong>: The subject of this chapter, which we will focus on in detail. This is where we set the user-facing elements, or the frontend. We usually define a container element, <strong class="source-inline">html.Div</strong> in the figure, that takes a list of components for its <strong class="source-inline">children</strong> parameter. These components will be displayed in order when the app renders, each placed below the previous element. In the following section, we will create a simple app with a minimal layout.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Callback functions</strong>: This is the subject of <a href="B16780_02_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor031"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Exploring the Structure of a Dash App</em>, where we will go through how interactivity works in detail; this won't be covered in this chapter. For now, it's enough to know that this is where we define as many functions as needed to link the visible elements of the app to each other, defining the functionality that we want. Typically, functions are independent, they don't need to be defined within a container, and their order does not <a id="_idIndexMarker024"/>matter in the module.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Running the app</strong>: Using the Python idiom for running modules as scripts, we run the app.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>As I promised, we are now ready to start coding.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-22"><a id="_idTextAnchor021"/>Creating and running the simplest app</h1>
			<p>Using the <a id="_idIndexMarker025"/>structure that we just discussed, and excluding callback functions, let's now build our first simple app!</p>
			<p>Create <a id="_idIndexMarker026"/>a file and name it <strong class="source-inline">app.py</strong>, and write the following code:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Import the required packages using their usual aliases:<p class="source-code">import dash</p><p class="source-code">import dash_html_components as html</p></li>
				<li>Create (instantiate) the app:<p class="source-code">app = dash.Dash(__name__)</p></li>
				<li>Create the app's layout:<p class="source-code">app.layout = html.Div([</p><p class="source-code">    html.H1('Hello, World!')</p><p class="source-code">])</p></li>
				<li>Run the app:<p class="source-code">if __name__ == '__main__':</p><p class="source-code">    app.run_server(<strong class="bold">debug=True</strong>)</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>A few points before running the app. First, I strongly suggest that you don't copy and paste code. It's important to make sure you remember what you coded. It's also useful to explore the possibilities provided by each component, class, or function. Most IDEs provide hints on what is possible.</p>
			<p>This app's layout contains one element, which is the list passed to <strong class="source-inline">html.Div</strong>, corresponding to its <strong class="source-inline">children</strong> parameter. This will produce an H1 element on the page. Finally, note that I set <strong class="source-inline">debug=True</strong> in the <strong class="source-inline">app.run_server</strong> method. This activates several developer tools that are really useful while developing and debugging.</p>
			<p>You are now ready to run your first app. From the command line, in the same folder where you saved your app file, run this:</p>
			<p class="source-code">python app.py </p>
			<p>You might need to run the preceding command using <strong class="source-inline">python3</strong> if your system is not configured to use version three by default:</p>
			<p class="source-code">python3 app.py</p>
			<p>You should <a id="_idIndexMarker027"/>now see an output like that shown in Figure 1.3, indicating <a id="_idIndexMarker028"/>that the app is running:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer008" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16780_01_003.jpg" alt="Figure 1.3 – Command-line output while running the app"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.3 – Command-line output while running the app</p>
			<p>Congratulations on running your very first Dash app! Now, if you point your browser to the URL shown in the output, http://127.0.0.1:8050, you should see the "Hello, World!" message in H1 on the page. As you can see, it shows that it is serving a Flask app called "app," with a warning that this server is not designed for production use. We will cover deployment in a later chapter, but this server is good enough for developing and testing your apps. You can also see that we are in debug mode:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer009" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16780_01_004.jpg" alt="Figure 1.4 – App rendered in the browser"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.4 – App rendered in the browser</p>
			<p>As specified, we see the text in H1, and we can also see the blue button as well. Clicking on this button <a id="_idIndexMarker029"/>will open some options in the browser, and it will be <a id="_idIndexMarker030"/>more useful once there are callback functions and/or errors while running the app. We wouldn't have gotten the blue button if we had run the app with <strong class="source-inline">debug=False</strong>, which is the default.</p>
			<p>Now that we have established a good-enough understanding of the main elements that go into creating a Dash app, and we have run a minimal one, we are ready to explore two packages that are used for adding and managing visible elements: first, Dash HTML Components, and after that, we will explore how to use Dash Bootstrap Components.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-23"><a id="_idTextAnchor022"/>Adding HTML and other components to the app</h1>
			<p>From now until the end of this chapter, we will mainly be focusing on the <strong class="source-inline">app.layout</strong> attribute <a id="_idIndexMarker031"/>of our app and making changes to it. It's straightforward to do so; we simply add elements to the top-level <strong class="source-inline">html.Div</strong> element's list (the <strong class="source-inline">children</strong> parameter):</p>
			<p class="source-code">html.Div(children=[component_1, component_2, component_3, …])</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-24"><a id="_idTextAnchor023"/>Adding HTML components to a Dash app</h2>
			<p>Since the <a id="_idIndexMarker032"/>available components in the package correspond to actual HTML tags, it is the most stable package. Let's quickly explore the parameters that are common to all its components.</p>
			<p>At the time of this writing, Dash HTML Components has 131 components, and there are 20 parameters that are common to all of them.</p>
			<p>Let's go over some of the most important ones that we will frequently be using:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">children</strong>: This is typically the main (and first) container of the content of the component. It can take a list of items, or a single item.</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">className</strong>: This is the same as the <strong class="source-inline">class</strong> attribute, only renamed as such.</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">id</strong>: While we won't be covering this parameter in this chapter, it is the crucial one in making interactivity work, and we will be using it extensively while building the app. For now, it's enough to know that you can set arbitrary IDs to your components so you can identify them and later use them for managing interactivity.</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">style</strong>: This is similar to the HTML attribute of the same name, but with a few differences. First, its attributes are set using camelCase. So, say you wanted to set the following attributes in Dash HTML Components:<p class="source-code">&lt;h1 style="color:blue; font-size: 40px; margin-left: 20%"&gt;A Blue Heading&lt;/h1&gt;</p><p>You would specify them this way:</p><p class="source-code">import dash_html_components as html</p><p class="source-code">html.H1(children='A Blue Heading',</p><p class="source-code">        style={'color': 'blue',</p><p class="source-code">               '<strong class="bold">fontSize</strong>': '40px',</p><p class="source-code">               '<strong class="bold">marginLeft</strong>': '20%'})</p><p>As you have most likely noticed, the <strong class="source-inline">style</strong> attribute is set using a Python dictionary.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The other parameters have different uses and rules, depending on the respective component <a id="_idIndexMarker033"/>that they belong to. Let's now practice <a id="_idIndexMarker034"/>adding a few HTML elements to our app. Going back to the same <strong class="source-inline">app.py</strong> file, let's experiment with adding a few more HTML elements and run the app one more time, as we just did. I kept the top and bottom parts the same, and I mainly edited <strong class="source-inline">app.layout</strong>:</p>
			<p class="source-code">…</p>
			<p class="source-code">app = dash.Dash(__name__)</p>
			<p class="source-code">app.layout = html.Div([</p>
			<p class="source-code">    html.H1('Poverty And Equity Database',</p>
			<p class="source-code">            style={'color': 'blue',</p>
			<p class="source-code">                   'fontSize': '40px'}),</p>
			<p class="source-code">    html.H2('The World Bank'),</p>
			<p class="source-code">    html.P('Key Facts:'),</p>
			<p class="source-code">    html.Ul([</p>
			<p class="source-code">        html.Li('Number of Economies: 170'),</p>
			<p class="source-code">        html.Li('Temporal Coverage: 1974 - 2019'),</p>
			<p class="source-code">        html.Li('Update Frequency: Quarterly'),</p>
			<p class="source-code">        html.Li('Last Updated: March 18, 2020'),</p>
			<p class="source-code">        html.Li([</p>
			<p class="source-code">            'Source: ',</p>
			<p class="source-code">          html.A('https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/poverty-and-equity-database',         href='https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/poverty-and-equity-database')</p>
			<p class="source-code">        ])</p>
			<p class="source-code">    ])</p>
			<p class="source-code">])</p>
			<p class="source-code">…</p>
			<p class="source-code">python app.py</p>
			<p>That should produce the following screen:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer010" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16780_01_005.jpg" alt="Figure 1.5 – Updated app rendered in the browser"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.5 – Updated app rendered in the browser</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">If you are familiar with HTML, this should look straightforward. If not, please check out a basic <a id="_idIndexMarker035"/>tutorial online. A great source to start would be W3Schools: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">https://www.w3schools.com/html/</a>.</p>
			<p>In the <a id="_idIndexMarker036"/>updated part, we just added a <strong class="source-inline">&lt;p&gt;</strong> element <a id="_idIndexMarker037"/>and an unordered list, <strong class="source-inline">&lt;ul&gt;</strong>, within which we added a few list items, <strong class="source-inline">&lt;li&gt;</strong> (using a Python list), the last of which contained a link using the <strong class="source-inline">&lt;a&gt;</strong> element.</p>
			<p>Note that since these components are implemented as Python classes, they follow Python's conventions of capitalizing class names: <strong class="source-inline">html.P</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">html.Ul</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">html.Li</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">html.A</strong>, and so on.</p>
			<p>Feel free to experiment with other options: adding new HTML components, changing the order, trying to set other attributes, and so on.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-25"><a id="_idTextAnchor024"/>Learning how to structure the layout and managing themes</h1>
			<p>So far, we have discussed the basic structure of a Dash app and gone through a brief overview <a id="_idIndexMarker038"/>of its main elements: the imports, app instantiation, app layout, callbacks (which we will cover in the next chapter), and running the app. We created <a id="_idIndexMarker039"/>a bare-bones app, and then we learned how to add a few HTML elements to it. We are now ready to take our app to the next level—from a layout perspective. We will keep working with the <strong class="source-inline">app.layout</strong> attribute and control it in a more powerful and flexible way using the Dash Bootstrap Components package.</p>
			<p>Bootstrap is <a id="_idIndexMarker040"/>basically a set of tools that abstract away many details for handling the layout of web pages. Here are some of the most important benefits of using it:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Themes</strong>: As we will <a id="_idIndexMarker041"/>see in a moment, changing the app's theme is as simple as providing an additional argument while instantiating the app. Dash Bootstrap Components ships with a set of themes that you can select from and/or edit.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Grid system</strong>: Bootstrap <a id="_idIndexMarker042"/>provides a powerful grid system, so we can think about our pages more from a user perspective (rows and columns) and not have to focus on the screen attributes (pixels and percentages), although we still have access to those low-level details whenever we need to.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Responsiveness</strong>: Having a large number of possible screen sizes makes it almost <a id="_idIndexMarker043"/>impossible to properly design page layouts. This is handled for us, and we can also fine-tune the behavior of page elements to control how their sizes change as the screen size changes.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Prebuilt components</strong>: A set of <a id="_idIndexMarker044"/>prebuilt components is also provided, which we will be using. Alerts, buttons, drop-down menus, and tabs are some of the components that Bootstrap provides.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Encoded colors</strong>: We <a id="_idIndexMarker045"/>also get a set of colors for easy communication with users, in case we have a warning, an error, simple information, and so on.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let's explore these features one by one.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-26"><a id="_idTextAnchor025"/>Themes</h2>
			<p>First, let's see <a id="_idIndexMarker046"/>how easy it is to change the theme of an app. In the same <strong class="source-inline">app.py</strong> file, add the following import and the new argument to the app creation call:</p>
			<p class="source-code">import dash_bootstrap_components as dbc</p>
			<p class="source-code">…</p>
			<p class="source-code">app = dash.Dash(__name__, <strong class="bold">external_stylesheets=[dbc.themes.BOOTSTRAP]</strong>)</p>
			<p class="source-code">…</p>
			<p>Running the app again, you should see that the theme has changed. As shown in Figure 1.6, you can also see other sample themes, and I also added their names and how to set them at the bottom of each page:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer011" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16780_01_006.jpg" alt="Figure 1.6 – Theme samples and how to set them"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.6 – Theme samples and how to set them</p>
			<p>You can see <a id="_idIndexMarker047"/>how easy it is to completely change the look and feel of the app, simply by changing one argument. Note also that the color and font size of the <strong class="source-inline">&lt;h1&gt;</strong> element were overridden in the style argument. We specifically set the color to <strong class="source-inline">"blue" </strong>and the size to <strong class="source-inline">"40px"</strong>. Usually, this is not advisable; for example, in the two dark themes in the figure it is very difficult to read the blue text. So, be careful when you make such changes.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-27"><a id="_idTextAnchor026"/>Grid system and responsiveness</h2>
			<p>Another powerful <a id="_idIndexMarker048"/>benefit that we get from Bootstrap is its grid system. When <a id="_idIndexMarker049"/>adding Dash HTML Components, we saw that we can do so by appending items to the <strong class="source-inline">children</strong> parameter of the main <strong class="source-inline">html.Div</strong> element. In this case, every added item occupies the full width of the screen and takes as much screen height as it needs to display its contents. The order of the elements in the list determines their order of display on the screen as well.</p>
			<h3>Displaying elements side by side in columns</h3>
			<p>While it's possible to do this by editing the <strong class="source-inline">style</strong> parameter of any HTML element, it is a bit <a id="_idIndexMarker050"/>tedious and can be brittle. You have to worry about too many details, and it might break in unexpected ways. With Bootstrap, you simply define a column, and that in turn behaves as an independent screen, displaying its elements on top of one another, with each element occupying the full width of this mini screen. Columns' widths can also be specified in powerful and flexible ways. The grid system divides the screen into 12 columns, and the width of a column can be specified by using a number from 1 to 12 inclusive. Figure 1.7 shows how the columns can be defined, and how they would change for screens of different size:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer012" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16780_01_007.jpg" alt="Figure 1.7 – The same column layout on two screen sizes"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.7 – The same column layout on two screen sizes</p>
			<p>As you can see, the two screens are identical, and the resizing happens automatically, while maintaining the proportions.</p>
			<p>In many cases, this might not be exactly what you want. When the screen width becomes smaller, it might make more sense to expand the columns to be more easily readable by the users. For this, we have the option of specifying the width of columns for each of five possible screen widths: <strong class="source-inline">xs</strong> (extra-small), <strong class="source-inline">sm</strong> (small), <strong class="source-inline">md</strong> (medium), <strong class="source-inline">lg</strong> (large), and <strong class="source-inline">xl</strong> (extra-large). These are also the names of the parameters that you can set:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer013" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16780_01_008.jpg" alt="Figure 1.8 – Granular control of column width based on screen size"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.8 – Granular control of column width based on screen size</p>
			<p>Figure 1.8 shows how this is achieved by setting two arguments for the column. The way to <a id="_idIndexMarker051"/>set these values is simple, as indicated in the figure. The full code would be something like this:</p>
			<p class="source-code">import dash_boostrap_components as dbc</p>
			<p class="source-code">dbc.Col(children=[child1, child2, …], lg=6, md=12)</p>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">lg=6, md=12</strong> arguments simply mean that we want this column to have a width of six when the screen is large (<strong class="source-inline">lg</strong>), which means 6 ÷ 12, or half the screen's width. On screens of medium size (<strong class="source-inline">md</strong>), set the column width to 12, which means the full width of the screen (12 ÷ 12).</p>
			<p>You might be wondering how we can have the columns in the middle of the page, and not starting from the left, as is the case in Figures 1.7 and 1.8. The width and the different size parameters can also take a dictionary, one of the keys of which can be <strong class="source-inline">offset</strong>, and this is how you set its horizontal location on the screen:</p>
			<p class="source-code">dbc.Col(children=[child1, child2, …], <strong class="bold">lg={'size': 6, 'offset': 4}</strong>, md=12)</p>
			<p>As you can see, <strong class="source-inline">lg</strong> became a dictionary where we indicated that we want that column to skip the first four columns from the left, and be displayed after that, in the specified size.</p>
			<p>Finally, if you want to place multiple columns next to each other, you simply have to place <a id="_idIndexMarker052"/>them in a row (with <strong class="source-inline">Row</strong>), and they will be placed next to each other:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer014" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16780_01_009.jpg" alt="Figure 1.9 – Columns side by side in a row"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.9 – Columns side by side in a row</p>
			<p>In order to produce the layout in Figure 1.9, we can simply place the three columns in a list and pass it as the <strong class="source-inline">children</strong> parameter to a row element:</p>
			<p class="source-code">dbc.Row([</p>
			<p class="source-code">    dbc.Col('Column 1', width=2),</p>
			<p class="source-code">    dbc.Col('Column 2', width=5),</p>
			<p class="source-code">    dbc.Col('Column 3', width=4),</p>
			<p class="source-code">])</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-28"><a id="_idTextAnchor027"/>Prebuilt components</h2>
			<p>While <a id="_idIndexMarker053"/>we won't cover them all, we will be using several of those components, and they are generally straightforward to create. Please check the documentation for ideas and details of each component: <a href="https://dash-bootstrap-components.opensource.faculty.ai/">https://dash-bootstrap-components.opensource.faculty.ai/</a>. We <a id="_idIndexMarker054"/>will shortly modify the app to include some prebuilt components.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-29"><a id="_idTextAnchor028"/>Encoded colors</h2>
			<p>Although you can set any color you want for text, background colors, and many other elements <a id="_idIndexMarker055"/>using its hexadecimal representation, Bootstrap provides a set of named colors based on the type of information you are trying to convey. This can be set as the <strong class="source-inline">color</strong> parameter in several components, and it would have a visual meaning to users. For example, setting <strong class="source-inline">color="danger"</strong> would cause the component to appear in red, and <strong class="source-inline">color="warning"</strong> as yellow. The available color names are <em class="italic">primary</em>, <em class="italic">secondary</em>, <em class="italic">success</em>, <em class="italic">warning</em>, <em class="italic">danger</em>, <em class="italic">info</em>, <em class="italic">light</em>, and <em class="italic">dark</em>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-30"><a id="_idTextAnchor029"/>Adding Dash Bootstrap components to our app</h2>
			<p>We will <a id="_idIndexMarker056"/>now add two new related <a id="_idIndexMarker057"/>components to the app: <strong class="source-inline">Tabs</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">Tab</strong>. As you might have guessed, <strong class="source-inline">Tabs</strong> is simply a container of <strong class="source-inline">Tab</strong> components. The result we are aiming for is adding a little more information to the page, and organizing it under new tabs, as you can see in Figure 1.10:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer015" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16780_01_010.jpg" alt="Figure 1.10 – Adding tabs to the app"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.10 – Adding tabs to the app</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">One of the most important skills to develop while learning Dash is code refactoring. While the latest version of the app is still very simple, it is a very good idea to make sure you know how to manually refactor the code from the previous version to the new one. The more components you have in your app, the more attention you will need to give to the refactoring details. I suggest you always do this manually and do not simply copy and paste the latest version of the app.</p>
			<p>In order <a id="_idIndexMarker058"/>to create the tabs, and get the <a id="_idIndexMarker059"/>new content in the form you see in Figure 1.10, you will need to make the following changes: </p>
			<p class="source-code">html.H2('The World Bank'),</p>
			<p class="source-code"><strong class="bold">dbc.Tabs</strong>([</p>
			<p class="source-code">    <strong class="bold">dbc.Tab</strong>([</p>
			<p class="source-code">        html.Ul([</p>
			<p class="source-code">            # same code to define the unordered list</p>
			<p class="source-code">        ]),</p>
			<p class="source-code">    ], <strong class="bold">label='Key Facts'</strong>),</p>
			<p class="source-code">    <strong class="bold">dbc.Tab</strong>([</p>
			<p class="source-code">        html.Ul([</p>
			<p class="source-code">            html.Br(),</p>
			<p class="source-code">            html.Li('Book title: Interactive Dashboards and Data Apps with Plotly and Dash'),</p>
			<p class="source-code">            html.Li(['GitHub repo: ',</p>
			<p class="source-code">                     html.A('https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Interactive-Dashboards-and-Data-Apps-with-Plotly-and-Dash',</p>
			<p class="source-code">                            href='https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Interactive-Dashboards-and-Data-Apps-with-Plotly-and-Dash')])</p>
			<p class="source-code">        ])</p>
			<p class="source-code">    ], <strong class="bold">label='Project Info'</strong>)</p>
			<p>As you can see, we have added one <strong class="source-inline">Tabs</strong> element, within which we added two <strong class="source-inline">Tab</strong> elements. In the first one, we simply used the same code that went into defining our ordered list. In the second, we added a similar unordered list with new content. OK, you can copy this part if you want! You can also see how to specify the labels of the tabs, by setting a value for the <strong class="source-inline">label</strong> parameter.</p>
			<p>Now you can run your updated app again, and make sure that the new content went to the right place, and that the tabs work as expected.</p>
			<p>We are now ready to add some interactivity to our app.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-31"><a id="_idTextAnchor030"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>We have learned how to create a minimal app and saw indeed how simple the process is. We then explored the main Dash packages used to create visual elements on a web page. With what we covered in this chapter, you have enough information to create almost any layout, with any elements you want on a page. The discussion and examples were not comprehensive, however. We will be using and discussing those components and many others, so you can master their use.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will turn our attention to the mechanism of adding interactivity to our app. We will set up the app such that the user will be able to explore different options by selecting what exactly they would like to analyze from our dataset.</p>
