			<h1 id="_idParaDest-353"><a id="_idTextAnchor352"/>Case Study – Financial Institution</h1>
			<p>In this final chapter, I will walk you through the steps to apply many of the capabilities and approaches discussed in the first 16 chapters. This real-world example will show you exactly what I would do (or lead my team to do) if I were presented with a similar scenario. While there are commonalities between real-world financial institutions and the case study in this chapter, this situation <span class="No-Break">is fictitious.</span></p>
			<p>Together, we will see how to apply the topics we have covered to highly regulated institutions. For this example, we will walk through a bank, but similar principles may apply to other highly regulated entities such as insurance or healthcare. I will focus on how to identify specific requirements for each forthcoming scenario, and how to modify the guidance in the previous chapter to meet the unique needs of <span class="No-Break">the case.</span></p>
			<p>There are three problem sets we will <span class="No-Break">explore together:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>How to identify quick wins during periods of <span class="No-Break">regulatory pressure</span></li>
				<li>How to message long-term solutions with high-value investments to executive <span class="No-Break">team members</span></li>
				<li>How to design iterative delivery <span class="No-Break">with impact</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-354"><a id="_idTextAnchor353"/>Scenario - highly regulated entity – banking institution</h1>
			<p>Over the last <a id="_idIndexMarker963"/>several years, data in financial institutions has moved from being a risk that needs to be controlled to recognizing that data assets represent strategic sources of insight to be leveraged across the enterprise. The role of Chief Data and Analytics Officer (CDAO), therefore, has moved from being more focused on the defensive angle to data and analytics (preventing bad things from happening) to offensive (using data and insights to drive additive revenue and customer experiences to the company). This change has moved the CDAO into the role of being a trusted business executive and out of the <span class="No-Break">back office.</span></p>
			<p>For the purposes of this case, we will look at <em class="italic">The Bank of the Midwest</em>. <em class="italic">The Bank of the Midwest</em> is a fictitious company serving approximately 25 states in the middle of America. It provides core financial products to its customers including checking, deposit accounts, retirement services, personal banking, mortgage and other loan products, and credit card services. <em class="italic">The Bank of the Midwest</em> also specializes in small business banking and prioritizes supporting small and medium-sized enterprises with customized solutions. Recently, <em class="italic">The Bank of the Midwest</em> has been under pressure from its primary regulator <a id="_idIndexMarker964"/>for some cash-handling malpractice and liquidity concerns in the current economic environment. As a result, the regulators have been focusing their examinations on their liquidity reporting process, as well as their data and reporting processes across <span class="No-Break">the bank.</span></p>
			<p>The Bank of the Midwest faced three primary challenges that needed <span class="No-Break">immediate attention:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>The regulators and the executive team are experiencing a tremendous amount of pressure to determine what can be done to fix the problems at The Bank of the Midwest. They expect swift action with results. You will need to determine what can be done quickly to show good-faith progress, <span class="No-Break">and fast.</span></li>
				<li>The bank is unclear on what the long-term plan should be to address the data and reporting challenges at all levels. Many senior managers are unfamiliar with data platforms, and you will need to figure out how to message these stakeholder groups in a way they will understand to support your needs and the needs of <span class="No-Break">the company.</span></li>
				<li>Finally, you will need to deliver iterative results, and as such, you will need a plan that shows quick wins and iterative delivery for the <span class="No-Break">long term.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>It’s important to note that you were hired to lead this effort and are the first chief data and analytics officer the bank has had in the role. There is a sense of urgency for you to join and make an impact quickly, but your stakeholders are also not sure what a CDAO does, and you will need to spend some time educating them as to what your job may be and how you are going to be able to help them with this <span class="No-Break">pressurized situation.</span></p>
			<p>As the leader of this effort, the following pages explain what you would do in <span class="No-Break">this scenario.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-355"><a id="_idTextAnchor354"/>Identifying quick wins</h1>
			<p>The Bank of the Midwest hired you as their chief data and analytics officer. You joined the company in the middle of Q1. After a bumpy Q4 and year-end closing process, the regulators <a id="_idIndexMarker965"/>discovered that the liquidity reporting used to manage the short-term cash position of the organization was full of inaccuracies. The primary regulator requested a full review of the report production, including all underlying systems and data flows, and a review of the company. This report is critical for banks because it compares their short-term assets (cash, convertible securities, and so on) and their short-term liabilities (deposits, short-term loans, and so on). By comparing the values, the bank is able to determine its ability to cover its obligations and avoid a liquidity event where the organization <span class="No-Break">becomes insolvent.</span></p>
			<p>You sat down on your first day with your manager: the chief operating officer. They explained that while your role as the CDAO is broader than addressing the concerns of this one report, it is a critical issue that you’ve been asked to lead the <span class="No-Break">remediation of.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Alternative option</p>
			<p class="callout">You could choose to push back on this request and suggest that you should focus on all key reports, with a focus on long-term solutions only. This option may provide a more strategic, long-ranging option; however, it will not address the immediate, urgent issue at hand: governance of the data and reporting process for the <span class="No-Break">liquidity report.</span></p>
			<p>Your ownership of this remediation effort was not well received by the chief risk officer because they are responsible for the company’s risk management process and are the owner of the liquidity risk oversight process, including report production. You taking the lead on this remediation project, and this is stepping into the CRO’s remit a bit. However, the regulator determined that the chief risk officer had failed to properly execute her duties as CRO in this situation and has been asked not to be a part of the remediation team by the CEO as <span class="No-Break">a result.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Alternative option</p>
			<p class="callout">You could suggest that the CRO retain this work and support them as a peer. This option could work if the CEO had not specifically requested you to take the lead. There are likely additional <a id="_idIndexMarker966"/>factors that you are not privy to that are leading to the CRO being excluded from this remediation work. You should work with the CRO to build rapport for your own onboarding and to understand how this situation unfolded. However, by deflecting or suggesting the CRO take the lead on this, you may undermine your own credibility, which is still being built as a <span class="No-Break">new hire.</span></p>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 17.1 – Partial organizational structure, The Bank of the Midwest</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-356"><a id="_idTextAnchor355"/>Initial discovery</h2>
			<p>You began <a id="_idIndexMarker967"/>by setting up conversations 1:1 with each of the CEO’s <a id="_idIndexMarker968"/>direct staff members, collectively referred to as the <strong class="bold">Executive Leadership Team</strong> (<strong class="bold">ELT</strong>). The ELT held a closed-door meeting without the CRO present to discuss the approach to handling this issue. You were asked to present at this meeting during the end of your second week on the job. Therefore, you had less than 2 weeks to understand as much about the problem as possible and frame out a rough plan for how to <span class="No-Break">address it.</span></p>
			<h3>ELT</h3>
			<p>You requested to meet with each of the ELT members, as well as select members of their respective <a id="_idIndexMarker969"/>staff to collect knowledge about the failures at The Bank of the Midwest. Everyone was willing to meet, including marketing—who shared this had been a real blow to customer sentiment. You also met with the lead regulator to gain insight into their view of the failures at <span class="No-Break">the bank.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Alternative option</p>
			<p class="callout">You could prepare an approach without meeting with the executive team to remove bias from existing team members who may have had a role in the company ending up in this situation. However, if you proceed without involving the executive team, you may risk burning bridges with key supporters you need to be successful as a new leader of the company. Secondly, you may miss key context that is required to build a successful <span class="No-Break">remediation plan.</span></p>
			<p>They all said that the report was currently consolidated by the risk team but was a cross-functional effort. Data was collected from the Small Business, Community Banking, and Investment divisions. Data <a id="_idIndexMarker970"/>from each <strong class="bold">Business Unit</strong> (<strong class="bold">BU</strong>) was submitted to Sally in Corporate Risk for consolidation and for final review and presentation to the Enterprise Risk Committee by the CRO. The CRO was recently layered under the COO as a result of this situation. After review by the Enterprise Risk Committee, the report is then published to the regulators, <span class="No-Break">as required.</span></p>
			<h3>Chief risk officer</h3>
			<p>Additionally, you asked the CRO to meet with you. After some deflecting, the CRO agreed to meet with you. You told her you were not there to pass any judgment, just to understand <a id="_idIndexMarker971"/>what she knew about the situation that would be important to work to solve. She explained that it was known to her that the liquidity reporting was very manual and that the team responsible for the report was very junior and lacked training on the importance of data quality. Because of this history, she had appointed Sally to consolidate the data provided by the various teams to enable “someone to do the job,” yet she acknowledged this wasn’t the right course of action, and someone in the BU should really be producing <span class="No-Break">the report.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Alternative option</p>
			<p class="callout">You could choose <em class="italic">not</em> to meet with the chief risk officer. Since she is being positioned as the person responsible for the issue at hand, you could avoid involving her in the remediation process. However, since she is still employed and still the chief risk officer, she still has a role to play, although a smaller one than before this issue emerged. You could choose to include or exclude her, but both options come with risks for you. I believe the complexity of the reporting process requires as much context as possible, and including her is an act of <span class="No-Break">good faith.</span></p>
			<p>She also <a id="_idIndexMarker972"/>mentioned that liquidity data was coming from various BUs, and ownership/accountability was unclear. When issues were raised, there never seemed to be a single person who would take on the task of solving them. Issues remained open for months or years in some cases. Therefore, there were known data issues with the report that continued to persist for long periods <span class="No-Break">of time.</span></p>
			<h3>Report preparer</h3>
			<p>You sat down with Sally, who was currently in a position of being the report preparer. She was clearly <a id="_idIndexMarker973"/>frustrated and a bit frazzled when you met with her. She was aware it was not “her job” to prepare this report, but it had fallen on her shoulders because no one else had been doing the job. Due to turnover in the business over the years, Sally had a lot of knowledge about how the report came to be. As the “natural historian,” she ended up in this role. Sally explained <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>She knew there were many issues with the report and, despite her best efforts, had not been able to get anyone to help her remediate problems in data feeding over to her (much of which was captured <span class="No-Break">in spreadsheets)</span></li>
				<li>She often received files with errors requiring fixes that <span class="No-Break">went unaddressed</span></li>
				<li>Sally had most of this knowledge in her head and was grateful someone was finally listening <span class="No-Break">to her</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>You suggested that while it was very appreciated that she had stepped in to support the company in preparing this key report, you were committed to finding the right person to run this process going forward, and she could resume her appropriate role of providing oversight. You asked Sally to document issues that were known to her to help get this process rolling, and <span class="No-Break">she obliged.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-357"><a id="_idTextAnchor356"/>Key themes</h2>
			<p>The ELT <a id="_idIndexMarker974"/>surfaced a few key observations that you put into your immediate action plan, which were further supported by <span class="No-Break">the CRO:</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Table 17.1 – Key observations from the report</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-358"><a id="_idTextAnchor357"/>Quick wins</h2>
			<p>Based on <a id="_idIndexMarker975"/>the key themes, you immediately implemented the following changes, which you included in your 2-week report going out to <span class="No-Break">the ELT:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Accountability</strong>: Identified a report preparer, Asha, in Corporate Finance to consolidate the data from all divisions into a single report. Because of the skillsets in the Finance department, this immediately increased the understanding and importance of effective controls over key <span class="No-Break">data elements.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Segregation of duties</strong>: Separated the roles of report preparation and report oversight to allow for an appropriate second line of defense over the liquidity risk reporting capability. This effectively allowed Sally to review and provide oversight of the report, which was her <span class="No-Break">appropriate job.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Training</strong>: Appointed the report preparer to own accountability of training everyone involved in preparing the report, including data stewards, data governance, risk management, report owner, and the CRO, to be educated on what the <a id="_idIndexMarker976"/>report was, how it was used, and the importance of following appropriate controls in preparing the report. This training focused on each person’s role and why it was critical, as well as what to do when problems <span class="No-Break">were identified.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Documentation</strong>: Report preparer, Asha, documented, in partnership with the technical data stewards, how data flows from source to report, which increased visibility into the complexities of the data used in the report and the process to prepare <span class="No-Break">the report.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Ownership</strong>: Appointed the chief risk officer, Sally, as the report owner, <span class="No-Break">clarifying accountability.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data quality</strong>: Gathered a list of known data and reporting issues. Created a process for Asha to continuously obtain and prioritize <span class="No-Break">known issues.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>You took a three-page summary presentation deck to the ELT outlining the scenario you found and the immediate steps taken to address <span class="No-Break">the findings:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer089" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18846_17_02.jpg" alt="Figure 17.2 – Summary materials for ELT"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 17.2 – Summary materials for ELT</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-359"><a id="_idTextAnchor358"/>Messaging long-term solutions to the executive team</h1>
			<p>After meeting with the ELT at the end of week 2 at the company, you were given full support <a id="_idIndexMarker977"/>to move forward with the next phase of the program: long-term sustainability. You put together a plan of attack for the long-range solution and reverted back to the ELT 2 weeks after the initial readout with the <span class="No-Break">following plan:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Establish data and reporting governance</strong>: This specific case became critical as the regulators identified concerns with this specific report. However, there is a lack of governance over all key reports reviewed by the ELT, which should be assessed, evaluated, and <span class="No-Break">governed appropriately.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Create policies</strong>: There is a need for formal policy requirements for how key reports are identified, the various roles needed to drive effective governance, the requirements for each role, and the location where key information is to <span class="No-Break">be stored.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Establish appropriate tooling</strong>: The company lacks appropriate data tooling to enable effective data governance. A data catalog, as well as a data quality tool, are needed as a <span class="No-Break">bare minimum.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Build a data quality framework</strong>: The company needs to appoint a data quality leader who will define a data quality framework for the enterprise. This individual will set and define requirements for data quality, aid in the selection and operation of tooling, and support the measurement and reporting of transparent data quality across the enterprise, up through <span class="No-Break">the ELT.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Automate reporting processes</strong>: The process of constructing the liquidity report highlights the manual nature of how critical reports are produced across The Bank <a id="_idIndexMarker978"/>of the Midwest. Where possible, automation of the reporting process will add speed to the process and reduce the risk of manual errors. This process will need to be designed and implemented on a <span class="No-Break">continuous basis.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Centralized data platform</strong>: The degree of manual intervention and use of spreadsheets to move data throughout the enterprise creates an environment with a high degree of manual time spent, as well as increased risk of error. There are hundreds of spreadsheets shared simply to produce the liquidity report, and when extrapolated across all key reports, this number increases sharply. Long term, there needs to be a centralized data platform implemented to provide a single source for data used to produce key reports and run <span class="No-Break">the business.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>You presented three options for how to move the long-term plan forward, including a variance in speed, staffing, and cost. The ELT ultimately approved a budget of approximately $8m to support the fastest and most sustainable plan you put forward. This plan included the strategic hiring of key personnel outlined in your plan, as well as the immediate hiring of contractors to get things moving quickly. The CFO and COO agreed to co-sponsor this work at the ELT level and will co-chair the Enterprise Data Committee to oversee this work going forward. Next, you presented these plans to <span class="No-Break">the regulators.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-360"><a id="_idTextAnchor359"/>Messaging to the regulators</h1>
			<p>After meeting with the ELT and securing funding, you met with The Bank of the Midwest’s primary regulator. In the first meeting, you explained your role and the immediate ask <a id="_idIndexMarker979"/>to address issues with the liquidity report and to drive overall data management for the company. You used the same materials from the ELT meetings (2 weeks into your role and the following meeting). The regulator specifically mentioned that he appreciated the transparency and consistency in sharing what was presented by management with him and <span class="No-Break">his team.</span></p>
			<p>Overall, the regulator liked the approach and the plan you had constructed in partnership with the CFO and COO. The only feedback he had was based on his confidence in The Bank of the Midwest and the duration of time between the identification of the problem and when you were brought in. Because of this, he requested that you add consultants to your plan to move the plan to execution a bit quicker and to validate your approach with a <span class="No-Break">third party.</span></p>
			<p>Your manager, the chief operating officer, was present at the meeting and supported the regulator’s request to bring in additional consultants to provide an outside opinion of your plan. This additional funding was <span class="No-Break">also approved.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-361"><a id="_idTextAnchor360"/>How to design for iterative delivery with impact</h1>
			<p>Next, you had to deliver on your plan. You set up a regular, monthly cadence with the Enterprise <a id="_idIndexMarker980"/>Data Committee to provide ongoing oversight of the program’s success, to ensure transparency and ongoing sponsorship of the work. You divided the work into <span class="No-Break">three buckets:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Immediate oversight of the liquidity <span class="No-Break">report transformation</span></li>
				<li>Long-range transformation for all in-scope data <span class="No-Break">and reporting</span></li>
				<li>Long-range implementation of data management and <span class="No-Break">analytics strategy</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>As you progressed through the design of this plan, each of the three buckets received time at the Enterprise Data Committee for an update. You presented a mix of short-term updates and long-range updates. For example, one area you focused on consistently was <span class="No-Break">data quality.</span></p>
			<p>In the first meeting, you presented the state of data quality: no framework, no leader, and no tools for measuring data quality existed. You leveraged the consultants to gather the state of data quality for the liquidity report to further quantify <span class="No-Break">the issue:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>70% of issues identified are related to gaps in basic <span class="No-Break">data quality</span></li>
				<li>75 people are manually deployed to reconcile data for <span class="No-Break">each report</span></li>
				<li>15 contract resources are used to manually <span class="No-Break">clean data</span></li>
				<li>8% of records are duplicated <span class="No-Break">across spreadsheets</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Short term, you presented how contractor resources funded by the program were able to reduce the number of these issues immediately. Longer term, you showed iterative improvement through automation and implementation of a central database and were able to measure the impact based on this initial baseline of <span class="No-Break">data quality.</span></p>
			<p>You followed <a id="_idIndexMarker981"/>a very similar approach for each area of your long-range plan, demonstrating not just the “win” at the end of the milestones, but specifically leveraging the information in <a href="B18846_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor110"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></span></a> to quantify the impact of the results at each milestone, focusing not just on what was delivered but why that was impactful to the business. You might have considered <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Percent improvement in data quality (for <span class="No-Break">example, 40%)</span></li>
				<li>Increase in speed of production of <span class="No-Break">the report</span></li>
				<li>Reduction in <span class="No-Break">manual processes</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Your team developed a “trustworthy” indicator for reports as a part of the program. This indicator articulated the confidence level in the report. If the report was fully documented, had lineage, and the quality was measured and within the threshold defined by the report owner as acceptable, the report was marked as “Certified.” This provided a level of confidence to the ELT that the report had been blessed by the chief data and analytics office and could be <span class="No-Break">relied upon.</span></p>
			<p>Further, the regulators were presented with the same materials as the Enterprise Data Committee, 2 weeks following each meeting. The regulators then had the opportunity to comment and provide feedback or ask questions. They became confident over time in the approach and eventually reduced the frequency <span class="No-Break">of meetings.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-362"><a id="_idTextAnchor361"/>Results</h1>
			<p>You were able to make these changes quickly due to the visibility of the problem at the ELT level and the regulatory push to make changes swiftly. You received great feedback for immediately taking action and implementing quick influence in the organization. Not only did this have an immediate impact on the company, but also established yourself as a key business leader. Here’s an overview of what <span class="No-Break">you achieved:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">At 3 months</strong>: You were able to demonstrate the end-to-end flow for how the report was created, had clear ownership and accountability for all key roles, and had a draft policy published for comment and review. You had begun vendor assessments for required tooling and were narrowing down the selection. You built a data quality framework, leveraged consulting resources, and began to implement manual quality checks <span class="No-Break">with contractors.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">At 6 months</strong>: You were able to show fully approved policies, a framework for scoping in key reports, clear ownership and accountability across all key reports, tooling implementation plans in place, remediation of immediate issues, and that the regulators had reduced their level of concern over The Bank of <span class="No-Break">the Midwest.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">At 12 months</strong>: Your team was fully functional. Implementation of the first releases of key platforms and tools was in production, and on-ramping was in progress. You had reduced the number of data quality issues by over 50% and automated 20% of all manual processes. The liquidity report had become the gold standard for your organization, and your team was able to move to other reports for <span class="No-Break">further enhancements.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Never waste a crisis. When you have the attention of a leadership team, as in this case study, you have the opportunity to show (not just tell) what can be done better, in a more trustworthy way, to manage data well. This is a great example of how to drive immediate value but also demonstrates what could be better with <span class="No-Break">long-term investment.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-363"><a id="_idTextAnchor362"/>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>As you reviewed the approach in this use case, in concert with the previous 16 chapters, I hope it is abundantly clear that there is no single approach for data governance. Every company and every situation is unique. What works at one company won’t work for a similar company in the same industry. This is why I offered alternative options in this chapter and examples throughout the book to showcase what has and has not worked previously for me. Ultimately, any data professional will have successes and failures in their career. One of the hardest lessons to learn (for me) is that what was recommended this year may have been recommended in the past but now is effective because the company is facing new challenges or priorities. Thus, sometimes, just changing circumstances will allow for the same suggestion to work in your environment now, whereas it was <span class="No-Break">rejected previously.</span></p>
			<p>The context matters. Your willingness to spend time to build trust in the capabilities outlined in this chapter will make all the difference in the success of your overall data governance program. The best advice I can offer, beyond what is technical based on the capabilities in <em class="italic">Part 2</em> or specific examples provided throughout the book, is <span class="No-Break">to listen.</span></p>
			<p>Your stakeholders are speaking with you about data because they believe, at some level, that you can help them. The best and most effective way to build solutions that matter, that truly make a difference, is to listen to your stakeholders and co-develop solutions that work for them. Conversely, the worst thing you could do is to come into an organization and apply a uniform set of suggestions that are not in any way unique. Start by listening. Then <span class="No-Break">build, together.</span></p>
			<p>The best way to make a difference is to do what was outlined in this case study. Listen, start to deliver small yet quick wins, message effectively to gain support, and deliver iteratively for impact. Finally, be sure to measure and report on your progress, transparently and often. By laying a foundation for open communication and continuous delivery, you will build trust <span class="No-Break">in data.</span></p>
			<p>I’m cheering <span class="No-Break">you on!</span></p>
