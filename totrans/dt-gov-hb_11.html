			<p>One of the less-focused-on areas of data governance, data operations, is often left out of the conversation. All companies have some sort of operational function focused on data, but they are often not visible to leaders. Data operations teams are often stuck behind visualization teams or governance functions, unknown to the company. What are they really? What do data operations teams provide to <span class="No-Break">the company?</span></p>
			<p>This chapter will dive into this topic. While I have shared previously that data governance tends to be unappreciated, I want to clarify that while true, I also believe it’s data professionals who are largely to blame for this lack of value. In this chapter, we will dig into what <em class="italic">you</em> can do to help bring into focus the value data operations bring to your organization and how you can show measurable value to the executives you <span class="No-Break">interact with.</span></p>
			<p><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Example</strong></span></p>
			<p>Imagine this: You are a sales executive, and it’s crunch time. It’s the last day of the quarter, and you have a big deal to close. You have a verbal commitment from the customer, and now you just need to get that final order over to them for processing so that the sale hits this quarter’s books. Only there’s <span class="No-Break">one problem.</span></p>
			<p><em class="italic">The transaction </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">is stuck.</em></span></p>
			<p>Somewhere in the flow of the transaction, between the quoting process and the order management process, the data isn’t moving. Time is running out. Your customer is ready to sign, but you don’t have the order for them to sign. This deal will mean meeting sales targets for the quarter and not closing the deal; well, it means you’ll just <span class="No-Break">barely miss.</span></p>
			<p><em class="italic">Now what?</em> <em class="italic">What do </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">you do?</em></span></p>
			<p>Most likely, you wipe the sweat off your forehead and start dialing. Usual contacts include CIO, CDO, and maybe even all the way to the top. In time-sensitive moments such as these, it’s not uncommon for the sales team to go straight to the top. However, there is a better way: calling your data operations team. They can help you in moments just <span class="No-Break">like these.</span></p>
			<p>I used this example because it is very real. I have seen this same situation play out in a number of organizations: some with great success and the ability to close deals such as these with ease. Others are not as fortunate. So, what’s the difference between them? A strong data <span class="No-Break">operations team.</span></p>
			<p>We will cover the following <span class="No-Break">main topics:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Defining <span class="No-Break">data operations</span></li>
				<li>Data <span class="No-Break">operations capabilities</span></li>
				<li>The value of <span class="No-Break">data operations</span></li>
				<li>Building an optimal data operations capability and setting up <span class="No-Break">for success</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-240"><a id="_idTextAnchor239"/>Defining data operations</h1>
			<p>Data operations are<a id="_idIndexMarker676"/> often left unappreciated in a data organization. I think of data operations like electricity: it may not be appreciated until you don’t have it. Data operations teams are often the glue that keeps things moving within a company, and depending on the way your company operates, the size and scale of the team may vary greatly. <strong class="bold">Data Operations</strong> (<strong class="bold">DataOps</strong>) is typically a set of practices, processes, and technologies that enable an integrated and focused perspective <a id="_idIndexMarker677"/>on data using automation and manual processes to improve the quality, speed, and collaboration of data across an organization. Data operations is a fairly evolving field, which includes both practitioner perspectives as well as an influx of vendors. Because companies are increasingly relying on data for decisions and general organizational operations, data operations is becoming a more essential discipline with <span class="No-Break">additional focus.</span></p>
			<p>Data operations often sit in the middle of various capabilities across an organization and are the glue that keeps everything <span class="No-Break">working together:</span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-241"><a id="_idTextAnchor240"/>Data operations versus IT operations</h2>
			<p>There <a id="_idIndexMarker678"/>are some commonalities between<a id="_idIndexMarker679"/> data operations and traditional IT operations. Both are responsible for the overall health of the company’s operations; however, traditional IT operations typically focus on activities such as <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Monitoring <span class="No-Break">IT systems</span></li>
				<li>Maintaining <span class="No-Break">IT processes</span></li>
				<li>Implementation of <span class="No-Break">IT systems</span></li>
				<li>Upgrading <span class="No-Break">IT systems</span></li>
				<li>Ensuring ongoing data security and compliance <span class="No-Break">are maintained</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In many<a id="_idIndexMarker680"/> ways, data operations are not all that different, except instead of “IT,” replace <span class="No-Break">with “data”:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Monitoring <span class="No-Break">data quality</span></li>
				<li>Maintaining <span class="No-Break">data processing</span></li>
				<li>Implementation of <span class="No-Break">data solutions</span></li>
				<li>Upgrading data processes <span class="No-Break">and solutions</span></li>
				<li>Ensuring ongoing data classification <span class="No-Break">and compliance</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The goals <a id="_idIndexMarker681"/>and objectives are slightly different, but overall, both operations groups support the ongoing running of a company. The primary objective of IT operations is to ensure that IT systems are reliable, secure, and efficient, whereas the primary objective of data operations is to make data more accessible, usable, <span class="No-Break">and valuable.</span></p>
			<p>Data operations are occasionally a part of data engineering teams in that they are responsible for building and maintaining data pipelines. Data engineers are typically the profile and expertise hired to support data operations functions within an organization. The key distinction is data operations teams are more often brought in to fix and provide operational support versus building new, whereas data engineering teams are more <span class="No-Break">often focused.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-242"><a id="_idTextAnchor241"/>IT and data operations partnerships</h2>
			<p>Ever <a id="_idIndexMarker682"/>more, IT and data operations teams are working together. It is very important to align roles and responsibilities<a id="_idIndexMarker683"/> between these two teams so that there is no confusion about which team is responsible for what tasks. However, when both IT and data operations support each other, the results and seamless experience for the company become very fluid <span class="No-Break">and effective.</span></p>
			<p>By working together, these two functions can enable a breakdown in siloed work and improve the overall flow of data from source all the way to insight. In many cases, a business leader will request something to move through the organization “faster” but does not realize it takes both IT and data teams to make that happen. To move effectively, the<a id="_idIndexMarker684"/> IT and data teams must work together to deliver a delightful experience to the business leader. When the teams work together, you may design an interaction model such<a id="_idIndexMarker685"/> that the following outcomes <span class="No-Break">are achieved:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>The data team meets with the business to understand the business needs and to <span class="No-Break">define success</span></li>
				<li>The data and IT teams work together to define both business and functional requirements for both teams, as well as who will deliver on <span class="No-Break">the requirements</span></li>
				<li>IT operations can provide the data operations team with the infrastructure and resources needed to build the appropriate <span class="No-Break">data pipelines</span></li>
				<li>Data operations can provide IT operations data insights that can help identify where there may be issues stemming from <span class="No-Break">IT operations</span></li>
				<li>The two teams can collaborate on governance and security to ensure that the business leader’s solution is moved to production with governance and security built in <span class="No-Break">by design</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>I have seen these lines blurred and, in some cases, combined. Unfortunately, when that happens, IT operations are usually distracted by their primary focus (that is, IT operations), and data needs tend to take a backseat to the operations of the IT systems. I strongly recommend maintaining a separation between these two functions to enable fluidity in the service of data to <span class="No-Break">your organization.</span></p>

			<p>Data operations<a id="_idIndexMarker686"/> teams play a crucial role in enabling organizations to effectively manage and utilize their data assets. They provide a range of data capabilities that empower data-driven decision-making and enhance overall business operations. Data operations teams are often made up of individuals who have a wide-ranging understanding of a wide variety of systems, are deeply skilled in various computer languages, and can pivot quickly when <span class="No-Break">issues arise.</span></p>

			<p>Data operations teams are responsible for wide-ranging capabilities that may include “other duties as assigned” given their level of access and wide-ranging skillsets. Because of their need to have wide-ranging access to be able to fix issues as they arise, you need to have strong audit logging in place to be able to retrace steps and employ strong detective controls to see what was completed. Trust is not a control, so be mindful of their <span class="No-Break">wide-ranging access.</span></p>
			<p>Key data capabilities provided by data operations teams include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data integration</strong>: Data operations<a id="_idIndexMarker687"/> teams facilitate the seamless integration of data from diverse sources, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. They employ data integration tools and techniques to harmonize data formats, eliminate inconsistencies, and create a unified <span class="No-Break">data landscape.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data quality management</strong>: Data operations teams ensure the accuracy, consistency, and<a id="_idIndexMarker688"/> completeness of data throughout its life cycle. They implement data quality monitoring and remediation processes to identify and rectify data errors, ensuring the reliability of data-driven insights, as defined by the data quality team. Data operations teams often serve as the technical enablement, configuring the data quality rules into the data processes as designed by the data <span class="No-Break">quality team.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data warehousing and data lakes</strong>: Data operations teams establish and manage <a id="_idIndexMarker689"/>data warehouses and data lakes, repositories that store and organize large volumes <a id="_idIndexMarker690"/>of data for analytical purposes. They design and implement data storage solutions that cater to specific business needs and support various data <span class="No-Break">analysis workloads.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data pipelines</strong>: Data<a id="_idIndexMarker691"/> operations teams build and maintain data pipelines, the pathways that automate the movement, transformation, and loading of data from source systems to target destinations. They optimize data pipelines for efficiency, ensuring timely and reliable data delivery for analytics <span class="No-Break">and reporting.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data access and self-service</strong>: Data operations teams enable self-service data <a id="_idIndexMarker692"/>access, empowering business users to explore and analyze data without requiring constant IT intervention. They implement user-friendly data access tools and portals, fostering a data-driven culture within <span class="No-Break">the organization.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data governance and security</strong>: Data operations teams enforce data governance<a id="_idIndexMarker693"/> policies and procedures defined by the data governance team to ensure the proper management, protection, and compliance of data assets. They implement data security measures to safeguard sensitive information and mitigate <span class="No-Break">data breaches.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data experimentation and prototyping</strong>: Data operations teams support data <a id="_idIndexMarker694"/>experimentation and prototyping by providing data sandboxes and agile development environments. They facilitate the exploration of new data-driven initiatives and enable rapid iteration of <span class="No-Break">data-driven solutions.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data visualization and analytics support</strong>: Data operations teams collaborate<a id="_idIndexMarker695"/> with data scientists and analysts to <em class="italic">enable</em> insightful visualizations and reports that effectively communicate data-driven insights to stakeholders. They may curate datasets for the data analytics teams to use for their analytical and visualization purposes. <em class="italic">For clarity: Data operations teams do not create visualization or analytics reports but focus on curating the data to enable the analytics team to perform </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">their duties.</em></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Continuous improvement and monitoring</strong>: Data operations teams employ continuous<a id="_idIndexMarker696"/> improvement methodologies<a id="_idIndexMarker697"/> to identify bottlenecks, optimize processes, and enhance data capabilities. They implement data monitoring tools to track performance metrics and ensure the ongoing effectiveness of <span class="No-Break">data operations.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Change management and version control</strong>: Data operations teams implement<a id="_idIndexMarker698"/> change management practices and <strong class="bold">version control systems</strong> (<strong class="bold">VCS</strong>) to <a id="_idIndexMarker699"/>manage changes to data pipelines, infrastructure, and data models.

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.2 – Example data ecosystem</p>
			<p>Looking at the data ecosystem as a whole, the collective capabilities across data operations are the glue across the ecosystem. While data architecture designs the ecosystem, and IT <a id="_idIndexMarker700"/>implements the systems, the data operations team is what keeps the data flowing, accurately, and with trust, across the ecosystem. They connect with all parts of the company (data governance, IT, and business groups) to ensure that the users of information have what they need when they need it. In summary, data operations teams provide a comprehensive suite of data capabilities that enable organizations to derive maximum value from their data assets. By effectively managing and utilizing data, organizations can gain a competitive edge, make informed decisions, and achieve their <span class="No-Break">strategic goals.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-244"><a id="_idTextAnchor243"/>The value of data operations</h1>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker701"/>value of data operations lies in its ability to streamline and optimize the way data is collected, processed, and utilized within an organization. In a word: simplification. As with data architecture (<a href="B18846_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor189"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></span></a>), the more simplified and streamlined operations can be, the less opportunity there is for breakdowns, errors, and business impact. Out of principle, when data operations are designed from a simplified perspective, the value is clearer to understand, and the time to resolve issues tends to be shorter. Less time is spent trying to troubleshoot the root cause (fewer places for issues to occur) and blast radius (impact <span class="No-Break">of issues).</span></p>
			<p>When <a id="_idIndexMarker702"/>evaluating the value of comprehensive and high-functioning data operations, there are a number of value-adds, but these are the key areas I recommend highlighting for your data operations function (whether building one or simply telling the value story). Here<a id="_idIndexMarker703"/> are some key aspects of <span class="No-Break">its value:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong class="bold">Improved data quality and accuracy</strong>: Data operations practices ensure that data is consistently accurate and reliable. By implementing robust data validation and cleansing processes, organizations can reduce errors and improve the overall quality of their data. While your data quality team will set expectations, requirements, and so on, the data operations team will be employed to implement processes to clean and optimize the quality of the <span class="No-Break">data directly.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Enhanced collaboration and agility</strong>: Data operations foster collaboration between data scientists, engineers, and business analysts. Because data operations professionals work across teams to create solutions and solve problems, the team is able to drive unity across teams to solve problems faster. This collaborative approach enables more agile responses to changing business needs and <span class="No-Break">data requirements.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Increased efficiency and productivity</strong>: Automation of data processes reduces manual efforts and speeds up data-related workflows. This efficiency leads to increased productivity and allows teams to focus on more strategic tasks rather than routine data management. Your data operations team is well positioned to identify opportunities for automation. I have seen data operations teams act as automation seekers, finding all the options and creating a backlog to work through <span class="No-Break">over time.</span></li>

			<p>4.<strong class="bold">	Better decision-making</strong>: With high-quality, timely, and relevant data, organizations <a id="_idIndexMarker704"/>can make more informed decisions. Effective data operations ensure that decision-makers have access to the right data at the right time. Because data operations are uniquely positioned to identify automation as well as simplification opportunities and deploy them rapidly, they can speed the time to insight and enable decision-making to happen faster, at the speed the <span class="No-Break">business needs.</span></p>
			<p>5.<strong class="bold">	Scalability and flexibility</strong>: Data operations practices are designed to scale with the organization. As data volumes and complexities grow, data operations strategies help in managing these increases efficiently. With great monitoring, data operations professionals can identify where systems and pipelines are being stressed and can proactively suggest and <span class="No-Break">deploy solutions.</span></p>
			<p>6.<strong class="bold">	Risk mitigation</strong>: Proper management of data through data operations reduces risks associated with data breaches, compliance issues, and operational inefficiencies. It ensures data <a id="_idIndexMarker705"/>security and compliance with regulations such as the <strong class="bold">General Data Protection Regulation</strong> (<strong class="bold">GDPR</strong>) and the <strong class="bold">Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act</strong> (<strong class="bold">HIPAA</strong>) by <a id="_idIndexMarker706"/>ensuring consistent application of data protection controls throughout the <span class="No-Break">data ecosystem.</span></p>
			<p>7.<strong class="bold">	Enhanced customer experience</strong>: By providing a better understanding of customer data and behavior, data operations can help organizations tailor their products and services to better meet customer needs, thus enhancing the customer experience. This can be achieved through data observability metrics implemented by<a id="_idIndexMarker707"/> data operations teams across <span class="No-Break">data pipelines.</span></p>
			<p>As your data operations team creates value from the activities outlined in this chapter, I recommend keeping a running total of the value contributed to the organization through your data operations team. It does not need to be complex, but you do need to decide what ways you will measure value upfront. My favorites are <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Dollars saved/avoided</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Hours saved</span></li>
				<li>Risks mitigated (count or <span class="No-Break">aggregate cost)</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Automations implemented</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>A simple four-column dashboard can do a great deal to showcase your data operations value. Additionally, you can also add trends by tagging the type of changes for each of these four categories to demonstrate where the biggest impact is coming from. A mock-up example may look something <span class="No-Break">like this:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer065" class="IMG---Figure">

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.3 – Example data operations value stream dashboard</p>
			<p>In summary, data<a id="_idIndexMarker708"/> operations bring significant value by ensuring high-quality, accessible, and secure data, fostering a culture of collaboration, and enabling more effective decision-making, <em class="italic">but you must capture the value clearly and transparently to help the return on investment (ROI) for the team become visible to </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">the organization</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-245"><a id="_idTextAnchor244"/>The unsung hero of data governance</h2>
			<p>As I <a id="_idIndexMarker709"/>mentioned previously, data operations are often overlooked in organizations for several reasons. If you are working to educate your sponsor or perhaps your CFO to fund such a program, you may want to use these points to explain why this function is not always seen as a value-add, to help inform their decisions and dispel myths about an “<span class="No-Break">operations” team:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong class="bold">Lack of awareness</strong>: Many organizations are not fully aware of the concept of data operations or its potential benefits. Without this understanding, they may not prioritize its implementation <span class="No-Break">and/or funding.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Legacy mindsets</strong>: Some organizations are entrenched in traditional ways of handling data and may be resistant to adopting new methodologies. The shift to a more collaborative and agile approach can be challenging for those accustomed to siloed and hierarchical structures. I suggest explaining the data operations<a id="_idIndexMarker710"/> function like a data SWAT team. They are uniquely positioned to jump in and solve high-priority data issues at a moment’s notice. They can then go back to fully remediating longer-term solutions, but no other team has the perspective and skill to solve data issues the “old way” and still meet the speed of business in today’s <span class="No-Break">fast-paced environment.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Complexity and resource constraints</strong>: Implementing data operations can be complex, requiring a blend of skills in data science, engineering, and business analysis. Organizations may lack the necessary resources or expertise to effectively implement data operations practices. This is where ensuring executive understanding is so important. Showing the value of such a function is important, which is where the dashboard shown previously comes into play. Make it transparent and accessible to everyone. Maintain backend data as well so that anyone who wants to see how numbers were created can do so <span class="No-Break">with ease.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Underestimation of data challenges</strong>: Some organizations may underestimate the challenges associated with managing large volumes of data. They might not recognize the need for specialized operations to manage and utilize their data <span class="No-Break">assets effectively.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Focus on short-term goals</strong>: Organizations often focus on short-term objectives and immediate results. By taking a strategic investment in data operations, you will require a long-term commitment that may not show immediate tangible benefits, leading to their undervaluation. Encourage a 6- or 12-month window to give the team time to show impact. The first few months may be a slow start, but the compounding of time and the trajectory <span class="No-Break">will deliver.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="callout-heading">Primary Data Management</p>
			<p class="callout">In one company, we were beginning a large primary data management initiative. As a part of our business case, I had our data operations team go back and review all the issues and case data that they had maintained for the last 12 months to determine how many of their issues, how much of their time, and the investment made to address issues and/or cases that would be impacted by our primary data management initiative. It was shocking for everyone, including me. There were thousands of issues that had been logged related to customer hierarchy mismatches, incorrect or invalid contact information, invalid addresses for shipping purposes, and invalid industry codes, all of which would be enriched and standardized by our PDM implementation. The number of issues, the hours spent addressing these issues, and the cost to provide the data operations services to address the issues <em class="italic">alone</em> justified our cost to implement primary <span class="No-Break">data management.</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li value="6"><strong class="bold">Budget constraints</strong>: Data operations require investment in tools and personnel. In<a id="_idIndexMarker711"/> organizations where budgets are tight, there might be a reluctance to allocate funds for what is seen as misunderstood as a <span class="No-Break">non-critical function.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Overemphasis on technology over processes</strong>: There can be a tendency to focus on acquiring the latest data technologies rather than on improving data processes and collaboration. This tech-centric view can overlook the operational aspect of <span class="No-Break">data management.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Integration challenges</strong>: Integrating data operations team members into existing systems and processes can be challenging. Organizations might be deterred by the perceived disruption and effort required to integrate new processes or make changes without fully grasping the return on <span class="No-Break">that investment.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Silos within the organization</strong>: Data often exists in silos within an organization. Breaking these silos to implement a cohesive data operations strategy requires organizational change, which can <span class="No-Break">be difficult.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Competing priorities</strong>: Organizations often have multiple competing priorities. Data operations might be deprioritized in favor of more urgent or seemingly <span class="No-Break">impactful initiatives.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Addressing these <a id="_idIndexMarker712"/>challenges involves increasing awareness of the value of data operations, ensuring top management buy-in, investing in the right skills and tools, and fostering a culture that values data as a strategic asset. This next section will outline what you can do about these factors to gain the support you need to drive successful funding and positioning for <span class="No-Break">data operations.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-246"><a id="_idTextAnchor245"/>Making data operations more visible</h2>
			<p>As you work to <a id="_idIndexMarker713"/>bring the data operations team into the spotlight, making data operations more visible within an organization involves several strategic and practical steps. The path to support has been difficult for me, but the steps I outline next will help you get to the full support you need faster. I’d recommend following <span class="No-Break">this order:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong class="bold">Executive buy-in and advocacy</strong>: Secure commitment and support from top management. When leaders understand and advocate for the value of data operations, they gain visibility and legitimacy throughout the organization. Spend time educating and showing the potential value. Use business examples with an impact that matters for<a id="_idIndexMarker714"/> their <strong class="bold">business unit</strong> (<strong class="bold">BU</strong>) <span class="No-Break">or function.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Education and awareness campaigns</strong>: Conduct workshops, seminars, and training sessions to educate employees about the importance and benefits of data operations. Highlighting successful case studies and best practices can also help in raising awareness. Send out a monthly newsletter highlighting key wins for <span class="No-Break">the month.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Demonstrate value with pilot projects</strong>: Implement data operations practices in small, controlled environments initially. Use these pilot projects to demonstrate tangible benefits, such as improved data quality, efficiency, or decision-making, which can then be communicated across the organization. Use these pilot projects to highlight the value of your education and <span class="No-Break">awareness campaigns.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Integrate data operations into business strategy</strong>: This is a bit harder if your company and sponsor are resistant to investing in this area. However, it is important to position data operations as a critical component of the overall business strategy. This integration ensures that it is discussed in strategic meetings and considered in decision-making processes. Ask questions such as: What do we need to improve in our data ecosystem to make this process/report/metric/solution more efficient <span class="No-Break">or effective?</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Create a data operations team and champion</strong>: Establish a dedicated team and appoint a data operations champion (ideally, assign a business champion) who is responsible for promoting, sponsoring, and evangelizing data operations practices. This<a id="_idIndexMarker715"/> role can serve as a focal point for data operations initiatives and discussions. At times, focusing efforts on a single BU can be effective for gaining support. Your champion may emerge from <span class="No-Break">this BU.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Develop metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs)</strong>: It may go without saying, but you should define clear metrics and KPIs to measure the impact of data operations. Regularly sharing these metrics with stakeholders can help in highlighting their importance and effectiveness. Use your education and awareness campaigns to highlight your metrics and KPIs <span class="No-Break">with impact.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Internal marketing and communication</strong>: Regularly communicate the successes and progress of data operations initiatives through internal newsletters, meetings, and dashboards. Sharing stories and testimonials can also be effective. Testimonials are especially powerful when they come from <span class="No-Break">senior executives.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Encourage collaboration and cross-functional teams</strong>: Foster a collaborative culture by forming cross-functional teams that include members from IT, data science, business analysis, and operations. This helps in breaking down silos and making data operations a part of the broader organizational conversation. You may want to form a core team of dedicated data operations but also have a network that supports or engages when crisis situations arise. Formally name those individuals so that there is clarity about what your team will need <span class="No-Break">from them.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Leverage technology and tools</strong>: Utilize modern tools and technologies that can showcase the efficiency and impact of data operations. This not only improves operations but also serves as a tangible demonstration of <span class="No-Break">their value.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Feedback and continuous improvement</strong>: Encourage feedback from all levels of<a id="_idIndexMarker716"/> the organization on data operations practices and continuously improve based on this feedback. This approach keeps data operations relevant and top-of-mind within the organization. The most expected feedback you will receive is about moving faster. That’s a great thing—you can use that feedback to request additional support (funding and headcount) if your company is seeing <span class="No-Break">the impact.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>By adopting these strategies, data operations can gain more visibility and recognition as a key contributor to the organization’s overall efficiency, data quality, and decision-making capabilities. By driving with an impact-led approach, your team will focus on making a difference versus closing cases. This mindset will ensure your team remains supported and is recognized for impactful work versus as a <span class="No-Break">back-office function.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-247"><a id="_idTextAnchor246"/>Building an optimal data operations capability and setting up for success</h1>
			<p>Building an <a id="_idIndexMarker717"/>optimal data operations function involves a blend of strategic planning, technology implementation, and fostering a culture of collaboration and continuous improvement. The core design of this team makes for a successful and organization-wide solution. Here are key steps to set up the optimal team <span class="No-Break">for impact:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong class="bold">Define clear objectives and scope</strong>: Start by clearly defining what you want to achieve with your data operations function. This could include goals such as improving data quality, accelerating data pipeline development, or enhancing collaboration <a id="_idIndexMarker718"/>between teams. You may focus on one area that is in need first, and then grow to support other functions over time. If your company is going through a big transformation (for example, implementation of a new ERP), you may want to focus on supporting that initiative as a priority to ensure a successful <span class="No-Break">program implementation.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Assess current capabilities and needs</strong>: Evaluate your current data management practices, tools, and infrastructure. Identify gaps, inefficiencies, and areas for improvement that the data operations function can address. Where do you have areas of need? Where can you demonstrate <span class="No-Break">immediate impact?</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Develop a strategy and roadmap</strong>: Create a strategic plan that outlines how you will develop your data operations capabilities. This should include short-term and long-term goals, milestones, and a roadmap for implementation. Perhaps you will address priority issues immediately, while you also build routines, rhythms, and processes to support your data operations team’s strategic focus. Lay out the priorities and how you will build the function while you <span class="No-Break">are delivering.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Establish a cross-functional team</strong>: Data operations require collaboration across different areas of expertise. Form a team that includes data engineers, data scientists, IT professionals, and business analysts. Ensure there is a clear understanding of roles and responsibilities. The most successful data operations teams I have led came from various parts of the company and formed a starter team together. The domain expertise from the business helped us gain momentum and deliver impactful solutions quickly. Outside hires came second, and that sequencing was critical to our <span class="No-Break">early success.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Invest in the right tools and technologies</strong>: Choose tools and technologies that support data operations principles such as automation, version control, <strong class="bold">continuous integration/continuous deployment</strong> (<strong class="bold">CI/CD</strong>), and monitoring. Look for solutions that integrate well with your existing systems. You don’t need fancy tools to get started, but you may want to consider investing<a id="_idIndexMarker719"/> in more advanced tooling as you scale <span class="No-Break">your team.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Implement agile and lean methodologies</strong>: Adopt agile and lean methodologies to streamline processes. This includes iterative development, sprints, stand-ups, and retrospectives to ensure continuous improvement. In most cases, you will need to move quickly. Prioritization will be key. Develop a methodology or triage process to support your <span class="No-Break">agile processes.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Automate data pipelines</strong>: Automate as much of the data pipeline as possible, from data collection and processing to analysis and reporting. Automation reduces manual errors and frees up time for more strategic work. As your team becomes intimate with the data environment, you will organically identify opportunities for automation. Keep this logged so that when there are times between crises, your team can focus on these longer-term impacts. You may also consider splitting your team into crisis management and long-term automation to support the variation <span class="No-Break">in need.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Ensure data quality and governance</strong>: Implement robust data quality checks and governance policies. This includes data validation, cleansing, and ensuring compliance with data privacy and protection regulations. Work very closely with your data <span class="No-Break">governance leader.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Foster a culture of collaboration and experimentation</strong>: Encourage open communication and collaboration between different teams. Create an environment where experimentation and innovation are valued. Celebrate collaboration in meetings to encourage <span class="No-Break">this culture.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Regularly monitor, measure, and optimize</strong>: Continuously monitor the performance of your data operations function. Use metrics and KPIs to measure success and identify areas for improvement. Make these metrics and KPIs outwardly available. Transparency <span class="No-Break">is key.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Train and develop skills</strong>: Invest in training and development programs to ensure<a id="_idIndexMarker720"/> your team has the necessary skills and knowledge. This includes both technical skills and soft skills such as collaboration and problem-solving. I highly recommend rotating key talent into and out of this team. Spending time in data operations will expand their knowledge of how data is moving through the company and where the challenges are with first-hand experience. This perspective is valuable and will be a great asset for your high-potential leaders <span class="No-Break">to gain.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Align with business goals</strong>: Ensure that your data operations initiatives are closely aligned with broader business goals and objectives. This helps in demonstrating the value of data operations to the organization, and focusing efforts on overall company priorities will enable transformations to be even more impactful. This provides higher ROI on larger investments, which is a great way for your data organization at large to <span class="No-Break">show impact.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Feedback and iteration</strong>: Never forget that feedback is a gift. Create mechanisms for feedback from end users and stakeholders. Use this feedback for iterative improvements. Be willing and able to evolve as <span class="No-Break">needs change.</span></li>
			</ol>
