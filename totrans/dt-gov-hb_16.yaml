- en: As the implementation of data governance occurs, the chief data and analytics
    officer and their leadership team must keep all messaging on delivering trusted
    results that are framed in business outcomes. This mindset requires CDAOs and
    their teams to think beyond “data metrics” into outcomes that matter to the business.
    In this chapter, you will learn how to ensure consistency in what was promised
    to stakeholders versus what was actually delivered, how to explain variances in
    expected delivery versus real results, and why that is trust building. Last, you
    will learn how to message back to stakeholders powerfully during delivery for
    impact.

    bring us to a final view, and that is to pull together a standard end-to-end data
    governance approach. As we have covered over the last 15 chapters, you will have
    to customize this model to meet your individual needs. I also want to highlight
    that this model is not unique. Over the last 10-plus years, I have seen variations
    of this model produced by endless consultants in every firm I’ve interacted with.
    Thus, this is my twist on a model that I have seen over and over again.

    will, adjusting where needed, and staying focused on making an impact that can
    be measured. All along this journey, message clearly what you must do to set up
    capabilities that may or may not be “felt” or measurable to the business, and
    also what is directly impacting the business that they can feel and we can measure.
    Don’t be afraid to state when something is foundational that will serve another
    capability. This delineation and clarity is critical.

- en: When messaging stakeholders about new data solutions for impact, it’s crucial
    to tailor your approach to their interests and concerns. Remember that any variance
    from what their perception is (not necessarily what you told them, but what they
    expect) is a cause for questions. The burden lies with you to support their understanding
    with credible facts regarding your teams’ impact. It’s important to deliver trusted
    results with the stakeholders in mind. Let’s recap a few key components of how
    to frame messaging.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the worst examples of messaging with stakeholders I have been a part
    of was meeting individually with top leaders but with overly generic materials.
    When you take time to meet individually but use generic materials, it does not
    take advantage of the incredible opportunity you have as a leader to showcase
    exactly, and with specificity, what you and your team do for the stakeholder group.
    By using generic materials, you miss out on a much more enriched conversation
    about the stakeholders’ specific benefits received from your team.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you are presenting in a large forum with stakeholders, it can still be disheartening
    to be generic. Use specific use cases to demonstrate how your team is adding value
    to stakeholders, and, better yet, have the stakeholders present those examples
    for even more high-impact communication.

    when things do not go well. In transformational programs, when things start to
    slip or don’t go as planned, it is typical for leaders to work to make things
    green or paint a picture that is optimized for steering committees or other forums
    where reporting is communicated.

    If you are open and transparent with leadership when you are in a yellow or red

    tend to believe your reporting and delivery as effective, more so than a team
    that is continuously in green.

    A great way to model this is by stating something like, “I see we didn’t hit our
    goal here. What can we do to help?” This acknowledges the expected results were
    not met, but also indicates that you are in the problem with your team. This is

- en: Data architecture is the blueprint of how a company manages its data. Good data
    architecture defines how data is collected, stored, accessed, and processed and
    how it moves and is consumed. Data architecture is useful to ensure data moves
    in accordance with business needs and is accessible in the flow of business activities
    effectively.

- en: Data operations (often referred to as DataOps) is a consistent set of processes
    and technologies that are designed to improve the flow and management of data
    within a company. Usually, DataOps functions are focused on automating processes,
    driving effective collaboration, improving data quality and **time to insight**
    (**TTI**), and reducing costs to serve. More mature DataOps functions focus on
    increasing innovation and exploration of data and may create new data assets for
    scale across the company.

- en: This chapter concludes the core content of the book. After over 300 pages of
    content, it’s now up to you and your teams to activate the lessons in this book
    into outcomes for your company. There are so many evolving capabilities and new
    applications of old, which means this book will one day become out of date. I
    find that exciting! After working as a practitioner and passionate advocate for
    data governance for over a decade, I know there is so much more that can be done
    to optimize data governance capabilities. With improvements and innovation occurring
    every day, I have so much hope for the future of this discipline.

    like you and me to help them get there. If you take nothing away from the contents
    of this book than to be a humble partner for your business stakeholders, not working
    in parallel, but in the trenches of delivering great results with them, together,
    then that’s good enough for me. Data governance serves the company. As a data
    governance leader, that means you serve your stakeholders. Never lose sight of
    that. By striving to support the company, support great outcomes, and do so in
    a simple, straightforward manner, you will deliver trust in data. In the very
    last chapter, we will take all of the lessons from the book and apply them to
    a case study for a regulated entity: a bank.'
