			<p>Welcome to the final chapter of this book! In this chapter, we will learn from the best, from Streamlit creators with experience creating dozens of apps and components, Streamlit power users turned Streamlit employees, and even the founder of the Streamlit library who now runs the fledgling company supporting the library's development. We sat down and interviewed four different users and learned about their backgrounds, their experience with Streamlit, and what tips they have for users of all experience levels. From these interviews, we will learn how they use Streamlit on a day-to-day basis at work, for teaching, and also about where Streamlit is going from here.</p>
			<p>This chapter is grouped into four interviews:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Fanilo Andrianasolo, Streamlit creator and tech lead at Worldline</li>
				<li>Johannes Rieke, Streamlit creator turned engineer</li>
				<li>Adrien Treuille, Streamlit founder and CEO</li>
				<li>Charly Wargnier, Streamlit creator and SEO consultant </li>
			</ul>
			<p>First, let's start with Fanilo! </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-129"><a id="_idTextAnchor132"/>Interview #1 – Fanilo Andrianasolo </h1>
			<p>(Tyler) Hey, Fanilo! Before <a id="_idIndexMarker432"/>we get <a id="_idIndexMarker433"/>started, do you want to introduce yourself to the readers? What's your background? What do you spend your time doing, and who do you work for?</p>
			<p>(Fanilo) Hello, everybody! My name is Fanilo Andrianasolo, I'm from Madagascar, and I work at Worldline, which is one of the leading European companies in digital payments and transactional services. I work there as a data science and business intelligence advocate and tech lead, where I help internal product and development teams to prototype new data science use cases, architect those use cases, and then put them into production. So, most of my work is focused on integrating data analytics inside Worldline, which is a huge task because it covers multiple industries from finance, for example, fraud detection, retail, and customer analysis. And I'm also a data science advocate, so I build and present multiple talks internally or to prospective customers where I can show them, "This is data science, don't worry, it's not that hard" or "This is a random forest, don't worry, it's not as complex as what you may think." And on the side, I am a university lecturer in big data and NoSQL in Lyon where I teach about 50 hours a year. It's an amazing opportunity to be able to talk to students and watch them grow into amazing software engineers and data scientists!</p>
			<p>(Tyler) That sounds awesome! You basically have, the way that I see it, two very interesting roles where you have to explain data science concepts to others, one at work and then another at university. Do you use Streamlit in both situations?</p>
			<p>(Fanilo) Yes, I do! When I discovered Streamlit, it was for internal work. At first, I was working on<a id="_idIndexMarker434"/> tracking some metrics from<a id="_idIndexMarker435"/> different machines and wanted to showcase them without using Jupyter Notebook, because I didn't want to click and run each cell every time. And I tried Streamlit and I was really hooked by how fast and easy it was to use it to build something. </p>
			<p>For my university lectures where I'm doing mostly PySpark, MongoDB, and Elasticsearch lectures, I demo those through their Python plugins. I would show a Streamlit app with the code on the side, I would change the code in front of my students, and all the Python variables would update on the app in real time. When you write this code that builds some MapReduce job, for example, in PySpark, it's easy to show them the code live and even do some coding exercises together. To show how the code works, I just put a function inside the code and the result is directly on the right in the Streamlit app. It's really dynamic and is a really easy way for me to show and tell the code. </p>
			<p>(Tyler) Is there a difference in how you develop Streamlit apps for the two groups? I feel like there's a lot of similarities there but what are the differences?</p>
			<p>(Fanilo) For students, it's going to be a single script that is going to run from the top to the bottom so it's easy to follow; it's like a live demo for them. Whereas when I'm at my company, I'm going to integrate Streamlit into bigger projects so there is usually already a project structure with a folder dedicated to UI work. For work projects, Streamlit apps are going to use functions from multiple libraries and multiple modules so it's a little bit different. The way we distribute and use the Streamlit app at work is also a little bit different because at university, I can just do anything on my machine. When I'm at work, I have to worry about more, like can I put this into the cache? Can I rewrite a colleague's function because it cannot go into Streamlit hashing? Constraints in my professional work make it a little bit more complex to write Streamlit apps.</p>
			<p>(Tyler) I'm curious how you do your deployment at work. Do you do it on Heroku servers to use Streamlit for Teams? Or do you do it all locally?</p>
			<p>(Fanilo) We have two servers internally on-prem where I deploy my Streamlit apps. There are not a lot of people using Streamlit inside the company, so I can just host the app on a server temporarily so marketing can play with the app. And the more techy people that don't know Python, I just send them the scripts and tell them how to run it with Anaconda.</p>
			<p>(Tyler) So you<a id="_idIndexMarker436"/> talked a bit about your first<a id="_idIndexMarker437"/> time using Streamlit. Did you find out about it on Twitter, or from a forum somewhere? What got you started? What was your original use case?</p>
			<p>(Fanilo) I think I heard about it from Twitter. At first, I dismissed it thinking, "Oh, it's just another Python library, I'll just put it in my to-do list to try one day." And I tried it 2 months later when I was working on a real-time data science demo for a prospective customer. They wanted to track visit metrics from different websites and visualize them. Actually, a good proportion of our customers just ask us for some data analysis. They have not thought of KPIs, analytics business use cases, or business questions to answer through data. Those are always hard to start and I usually build them a small interactive demo to help them understand the data science process. And that's where I thought, "Oh, I should give Streamlit a try." </p>
			<p>Before this, I actually did a demonstration for another customer using Jupyter Notebook and the customer was not interested because they saw it as too technical; they didn't like seeing code. And so, I thought for this customer maybe I should try Streamlit to showcase a grid of plots, using sliders just to decide how much of the data you want to visualize. For this problem, we wanted to do windowing over a set of dates to answer what the mean number of visits on those websites is, and wanted to be able to decide on the size of the window. We could just put that in the sidebar in Streamlit, which was a good opportunity to show the customer the results in real time. So we added this slider to the Streamlit app and gave it to the customer, and you can see when there's a spike that you can analyze further. And yeah, that's how I got to know more about Streamlit, just through demoing data science internally and externally.</p>
			<p>(Tyler) That's happened to me so often, where the client doesn't exactly know what they'd like when they come with a request. What a great use case! One of the things I wanted to talk to you about is the Streamlit community of which you've become a pretty strong member over the course of the past year. What about Streamlit convinces you to continue investing in the ecosystem? </p>
			<p>(Fanilo) For me, the thing that hooked me into Streamlit really was the feedback loop that I missed from when I was doing frontend engineering. I could write some code, and I would see the results on my screen immediately. I could just edit the color in the CSS and see the change. And the fact that this feedback loop is so short in Streamlit, combined with the simplicity of the API, which makes building a basic app really easy, is what really hooked me into the framework. I also had this conversation with Adrian (Streamlit's founder) where I told him the feedback loop really reminded me of the web ecosystem <a id="_idIndexMarker438"/>and that for me was Streamlit's<a id="_idIndexMarker439"/> secret sauce. </p>
			<p>Another thing is the fact that now we can easily integrate web components into Streamlit, which makes it really easy for us to build more diverse web interactive apps for data scientists. I've always got this impression from talking with my students, or other coworkers, or people in meetups that they always struggle to build interactive apps where they can just select something or draw something and use this drawing as an input for their machine learning model. To do this, they needed to pre-draw, and then load the image into a Jupyter notebook, which takes too much time, but there are HTML components to draw on. Streamlit acting as a bridge between Python and the web through components is what gets us as creators hooked into pulling the web ecosystem into Streamlit.</p>
			<p>(Tyler) So speaking of web-based platforms, you've spent a lot of time building components like <a id="_idIndexMarker440"/>streamlit-lottie (<a href="https://github.com/andfanilo/streamlit-lottie">https://github.com/andfanilo/streamlit-lottie</a>), which we<a id="_idIndexMarker441"/> talked about earlier in the book, streamlit-drawable-canvas (<a href="https://github.com/andfanilo/streamlit-drawable-canvas">https://github.com/andfanilo/streamlit-drawable-canvas</a>), and <a id="_idIndexMarker442"/>even streamlit-echarts (<a href="https://github.com/andfanilo/streamlit-echarts">https://github.com/andfanilo/streamlit-echarts</a>). Can you talk to us a bit about how you come up with ideas for components?</p>
			<p>(Fanilo) So for those three components, I've got two different stories. I'm going to start with streamlit-lottie; the idea popped into my head on a Saturday night of boredom and scrolling Twitter. I saw nice animations using Lottie files and I thought to myself, "Oh, that's nice, I'd like to have some cool animations like this in Streamlit," so I just built it. And that's really it, wanting to bring more web components to Streamlit. </p>
			<p>For streamlit-echarts and streamlit-drawable-canvas, there was a bigger use case. I was on a tight deadline for a demo using TensorFlow.js years ago. I wanted to do training and inference on drawings and I spent 5 days creating the demo in the JavaScript ecosystem, mixing Fabric.js for drawing on a canvas and Echarts to show the results. It was very tough especially because it was my first real step into the frontend engineering world. And then when Streamlit came out, I wanted to see if other users could build this demo in hours instead of days if the Fabric.js and Echarts components already existed, so I extracted the code of this demo into external libraries and voilà! </p>
			<p>The thought process I have is always, what kind of new inputs and outputs can we bring to Streamlit? For example, can we bring real-time music input to Streamlit? Everybody in deep learning today talks about image and sound, so that would be a great component. And as an output, there are so many popular JavaScript libraries to display data in an interactive way that would be helpful for analysis. My goal is always, what kind of input and output that the web<a id="_idIndexMarker443"/> enables can I add to Streamlit? Hopefully web developers will want to build <a id="_idIndexMarker444"/>more things into Streamlit!</p>
			<p>(Tyler) You've probably seen a ton of Streamlit apps that use components of yours. I would imagine that you get really excited by some clever use of streamlit-lottie or streamlit-echarts. Are you just pumped when you see that sort of stuff? Do you have some specific apps that you really enjoy that are built off of some of the components that you have made?</p>
			<p>(Fanilo) Those are my first real open source projects, where I've put some effort into building and promoting them. I love that these tools are so flexible and can be used for so many use cases I would have never imagined, especially for streamlit-drawable-canvas. I saw there was a user who would display a side view of a soccer field in Streamlit, then he would draw the limits of the terrain inside the canvas over the field image, and then do some 3D remapping to transform it to a top view and be able to analyze the position of the players. I was like, wow, who does that? </p>
			<p>There are people using Streamlit for medical purposes. For example, they want to draw on every slice of a stack of images the position of some molecules so they can draw a kind of 3D version of this molecule. I've even seen an app from Jina AI where they built a Pokémon recognizer (<a href="https://github.com/jina-ai/integration-streamlit-pokemon">https://github.com/jina-ai/integration-streamlit-pokemon</a>)! So you would draw a Pokémon, and it would inject the drawing into a neural network to recognize the Pokémon that you wanted to draw. Never would've predicted that, you know? Yeah, it's amazing.</p>
			<p>(Tyler) That sounds amazing. Do you have any tips for beginners getting started in Streamlit? Do you have anything that you wish you would have known, like when you first got started?</p>
			<p>(Fanilo) For me, it's consistent experimentation on new libraries. If there is a new Python library, I often just want to understand how it works. What happens if I change this argument, how does each parameter affect the output? So, I just bootstrap a new Streamlit script and import the library. And then for each parameter that you have, you can build a slider, a number input, a date input, and then you begin to build a demo of this unknown library, and Streamlit is only there to help you explore it to the fullest. Then you wonder how you can lay it out better, how to preserve some state for the app, and that's where you begin to dig deep into Streamlit. We talked a lot about the web ecosystem for Streamlit components. But I also think Streamlit is one of the best ways to showcase any Python library, anything from the Python ecosystem. </p>
			<p>Other than <a id="_idIndexMarker445"/>that, I'd say engage with the <a id="_idIndexMarker446"/>community online. The Streamlit community was really my first time interacting with an online community, with people who I didn't know nor meet at all. I don't remember the very first post or topic that I wrote, but I remember putting so much effort into writing it. I know it takes courage to ask questions in public, and I would say: dare to write a new post on the forum. If you're struggling with Streamlit or with Python, it's a good experience to try and post something in the community forums (<a href="https://discuss.streamlit.io/">https://discuss.streamlit.io/</a>) because people there are really nice; there are always people willing to help. I would encourage people to play with Streamlit and innovate, and then go on the forums and ask about what they can't figure out. There are a lot of very hidden features that are only available inside the forums, which is why I encourage people to go on the forums.</p>
			<p>(Tyler) Yeah, definitely. It's a very interesting case of accumulated knowledge sitting in small places on the internet. It's terrifying to ask because you're always like, "Oh, what if they think I'm really dumb?" That's often the first concern, signaling to others that you know what you're doing. But everyone seems incredibly nice in the Streamlit community, which is, frankly, a big change on the internet. </p>
			<p>(Fanilo) Yeah, maybe I'm so used to interacting with students that it helps me understand the fear of asking your very first online question to a "stranger." The worst thing that happened to one of my students is they wanted to clone a Git repo and the log showed that this folder already existed on their machine, so they could not clone over it. The answer is easy, in front of our very eyes written on the log, at least it's easy for us to interpret, right? But when it's your very first time coding, you have no idea what this log means, or that you should even check the log. So, I try to answer questions like I would answer my students coding for the first time and set this as a bar for our community, so everyone realizes we were all beginners at some point and that we should guide them into the gigantic Python/Streamlit world and not respond with "Go read the manual." </p>
			<p>One year ago, I was not into online communities at all. I was also scared of doing this. And now here I am, a forum moderator and Streamlit creator. One year ago, I would never have dreamed of doing this. So, ask questions, people! </p>
			<p>(Tyler) Thank<a id="_idIndexMarker447"/> you <a id="_idIndexMarker448"/>so much for your time, Fanilo! For anyone reading who wants to learn more, you can find Fanilo's GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/andfanilo">https://github.com/andfanilo</a> and his tutorial for building Streamlit components at <a href="https://streamlit-components-tutorial.netlify.app/">https://streamlit-components-tutorial.netlify.app/</a>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-130"><a id="_idTextAnchor133"/>Interview #2 – Johannes Rieke</h1>
			<p>(Tyler) Hey, Johannes! Before <a id="_idIndexMarker449"/>we get <a id="_idIndexMarker450"/>started, do you want to give us a quick intro to yourself? Where have you worked in the past, what do you do, what is your background?</p>
			<p>(Johannes) Hello! I'm from Germany, and currently living in Berlin. Well, as you know, I'm currently working at Streamlit and have been for the past 2 months but my background actually is in physics. So I did physics in my undergrad and I somehow got into neuroscience. I took a couple courses, did a few projects, and really loved it, especially the combination with computer science, doing simulations of nerve cells, the brain, all that kind of stuff. I got super interested in that. I decided to do my master's in computational neuroscience, which is kind of a combination of neuroscience on the one hand, but also machine learning on the other. In that program, I did a lot of stuff in all kinds of different areas of machine learning, like medical imaging, natural language processing, graph networks, all kinds of things. After I graduated from my master's program, I got into a couple open source projects. Well actually, I wanted to go traveling for a longer time but Covid came, and I had to get back to Germany earlier than I expected. And then I got into open source projects and started doing a lot with Streamlit, which is where I am today, working as a product engineer at Streamlit. </p>
			<p>(Tyler) Very interesting! When did you get started with the Python ecosystem? Was that back in your physics days? </p>
			<p>(Johannes) Yeah, that was long ago, basically at the start of my bachelor's or the first year of my bachelor's. I had already done programming since high school. Started out with Java, and then in 2013, during my bachelor's, I got into Python and really fell in love with it. Because for the stuff I was doing, starting with computations and simulations, and later machine learning, Python is just awesome.</p>
			<p>(Tyler) Did you do any machine learning in Java? I haven't seen a lot of ML engineers who work in Java or need to write anything in Java.</p>
			<p>(Johannes) I definitely worked in Python. Before I studied for my master's, I actually worked at a research lab in a gap year, and I did some computational stuff with C++ in that time but that<a id="_idIndexMarker451"/> was just horrible. If I had known about Python back then, I would have probably <a id="_idIndexMarker452"/>done everything in Python, and would have finished in a tenth of the time.</p>
			<p>(Tyler) I know a lot of people that will do most of their work in Python and then if they have some strong need to make an algorithm much faster, they'll switch to a lower-level language, which is excessive in the best way. So at that point, you were really involved with Python and had been coding in Python for a while, and then you kind of started making these machine learning projects in Streamlit, like your Traingenerator app (<a href="https://traingenerator.jrieke.com/">https://traingenerator.jrieke.com/</a>), which is a multi-purpose app to write machine learning code for you. What was your motivation for creating some of these? To give back to the community, showcase your work, create a personal portfolio, or something totally different?</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer123" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16864_12_1.jpg" alt="Figure 12.1 – Traingenerator app&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.1 – Traingenerator app</p>
			<p>(Johannes) Yeah, it's a<a id="_idIndexMarker453"/> combination of<a id="_idIndexMarker454"/> most of those points. I started using Streamlit in spring last year after I graduated. I had gone traveling after graduation, but with Covid, I had to come back to Germany and had obviously a lot of free time. Some of my friends and former colleagues had started working on an open source project, which was in the area of Covid tracing, and so I joined them. And as part of that, we needed a small dashboard and a friend had told me about Streamlit, and I tried it out and thought it was super cool. </p>
			<p>But that's basically how I started using Streamlit for fun. The Traingenerator app that I built actually had more business or start-up intentions. I thought, let's try my own project. And I realized I really liked the idea of training a machine learning model with a single line of code, like FastAI and PyTorch Lightning are doing. PyTorch Lightning is a library in the same area. I have worked a lot in machine learning, and often I've worked with very standard and basic models and just applied them to new datasets or new areas. One thing that has always annoyed me was that you're taking a super standard approach, but you have to write all this code to implement a model, or even if you have an implemented model, you have to test it and tweak it; you have to transform your data to work with that model. And you have to write code to track your metrics and experiments, all that kind of stuff. So my idea was more: could I build something that simplifies this process, maybe also with the prospect of becoming a viable product, a viable business? </p>
			<p>I had worked on that for a while, and then the idea for Traingenerator came up when I talked about this project with a friend and how a Python library to simplify this process is great, but it reaches its limits as soon as you want to build something more sophisticated; obviously, because you cannot easily go in and tweak stuff. We thought that it works great for prototypes, but as soon as you want to get a model into production, you have to start all over again. </p>
			<p>And then we <a id="_idIndexMarker455"/>had this idea of building a web app<a id="_idIndexMarker456"/> where you could put in what you want to train and which framework you want to use, and then it generates the code for you. And you can either use that code to train models directly, or you can modify it as you like, which is what Traingenerator does. </p>
			<p>The other things I built after that, like the GitHub 2020 app (<a href="http://gh2020.jrieke.com/">http://gh2020.jrieke.com/</a>), also the best-of-streamlit list, those were more like ideas just for fun, personal projects, certainly also for my portfolio. </p>
			<p>(Tyler) All of that is very interesting. I've used Traingenerator a few times and love it. At the time you developed it, which was before Streamlit Sharing was released, you deployed the app with Heroku. I'm curious if you would still do the same thing; what is your decision-making process for where to deploy your apps? </p>
			<p>(Johannes) The reason back then was simply that I wanted to have a custom URL that was short; I didn't want it to be a long, non-understandable URL. But I've actually moved it to Streamlit Sharing now! It's just a way better developer experience than Heroku, because the app updates within a second of pushing to GitHub, without rebooting or anything like that. Sharing doesn't support custom URLs by default yet, but there's a hack on the forum, which I'm using for now. And I've already annoyed our product managers quite a bit with this feature request, so I hope it shouldn't take too long!</p>
			<p>(Tyler) One other app you created was an app to dynamically create and share a user's GitHub stats called Year on GitHub (<a href="http://gh2020.jrieke.com/">http://gh2020.jrieke.com/</a>). It became quite popular; I saw it all over the internet fairly consistently. Can you talk us through that story? </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer124" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16864_12_2.jpg" alt="Figure 12.2 – GitHub stats app&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.2 – GitHub stats app</p>
			<p>(Johannes) For<a id="_idIndexMarker457"/> sure. So the reason or the<a id="_idIndexMarker458"/> idea behind it is actually a super random idea, I have no clue how I got it. There's no big story behind that. I had built Traingenerator already and it was incredibly well received. I did some more stuff with Streamlit, and then a couple days before Christmas, I got the idea to build an app where you just put in your GitHub username and it would show you some stats about what you've done on GitHub in 2020. And then you can tweet it. So it's similar to Spotify Wrapped that they do at the end of every year.</p>
			<p>A couple days after I had that idea, literally, a new Python library for GitHub came out actually for the GitHub API, which was super cool. And then I thought, obviously it doesn't make any sense to release something like this in March or April, which means I would need to build it in the next 2 weeks, and release it soon. So I worked on this all throughout my Christmas holidays and it was super, super cool. </p>
			<p>I think there were four or five hundred tweets generated with it. The creators of the Julia programming language used it. It was really nice to see and also the Streamlit employees saw all of the tweets, so I think that probably brought me half of my job.</p>
			<p>(Tyler) I have<a id="_idIndexMarker459"/> this theory that if you really want <a id="_idIndexMarker460"/>a job somewhere, you should make a Streamlit app for them that solves a problem of theirs or makes them notice you. And if you do that, you're just way more likely to actually get hired there. I've tried this a couple times and it usually turned into an offer down the line. </p>
			<p>(Johannes) It actually wasn't even intended at all. At that time, I hadn't even thought about applying to Streamlit, but it worked pretty well. In retrospect, I think they all loved it internally because it brought a huge spike to the Twitter numbers on the Streamlit account, and was super cool to see all the tweets about this new app. </p>
			<p>(Tyler) All of that makes sense to me! So after working on Streamlit for 8 or 9 months, you decided this is where you want to work, applied to a job there, and then got the job. First of all, congratulations. Second of all, what about the library makes you think that it's going to be like a big thing in the data science and machine learning community going forward? I have enough conviction about Streamlit to write a book on it so I clearly agree with you, but can you talk a bit about your conviction for the company in this space?</p>
			<p>(Johannes) So in my eyes, what is great about Streamlit is the developer experience and the simplicity of it. In my current job as a product engineer, I also look at lots of other web frameworks and solutions in that space, and I have to play around with them. And there are certainly other tools that have some cool functions that allow you to do more complex things than Streamlit because Streamlit is fairly young, but in terms of developer experience, how simple it is to start something and how fun it is to make apps, none of these tools even comes close to Streamlit. And I think that there are lots of pieces playing into that. </p>
			<p>On the simplicity aspect, you can just whip up an app in basically 5 minutes with a few lines of code. And it's just your normal Python script that you're writing anyway; you don't have to learn about other classes or anything about frontend development. It's very intuitive for newcomers. </p>
			<p>Then there's the live coding model of Streamlit, which allows you to code your app and Streamlit will rerun your app at the same time. And it's very intelligent about what it reruns, especially if you use the cache. I think that is what makes Streamlit so fun and addictive to work with, because you're getting this super instant feedback by instantly seeing the result. </p>
			<p>The other aspect is the community; the Streamlit community is just amazing. I mean, we have so many<a id="_idIndexMarker461"/> developers now who really like<a id="_idIndexMarker462"/> working with Streamlit. The forums are such a cool place to exchange ideas and to get tips, and there are so many people who are super dedicated, who are just answering questions in their free time for hours each week. </p>
			<p>We actually have like three, four, or five people within Streamlit who are working full time on the forum interacting with developers, sending swag to people who build Streamlit apps, which I think for a company that just has about 25 employees is very unique. </p>
			<p>(Tyler) I think of that dynamic a lot. When I started out, it felt like Streamlit was just a really good tool. And then I started playing around with it more. And then I realized that it might be closer to a toy, where I just have this constant iteration and feedback loop. And whenever you have something that is both a tool and a toy, it has worked out pretty well in the end.</p>
			<p>(Johannes) Yeah, definitely. I think one big aspect of why Streamlit is cool and why I think it's going to become even cooler at some point in the future is that there's a lot of parts to it, too. It's not just the open source library but it's also Streamlit Sharing, which if you want to deploy your model is super nice and easy to use. It's also, as I said, the forums where if you have a problem, you can certainly get help there. I think in the future, there will be lots more parts coming into the equation.</p>
			<p>(Tyler) You're about 9 months into your Streamlit developing experience. Do you have any tips for beginners getting started? Things that you wish you would have known?</p>
			<p>(Johannes) I actually think that there are not so many tips you can give to beginners, other than just try it out. Because that's the cool thing about Streamlit; if you start with it, you can basically get how it works after around 10 minutes. And it's just super easy to start. I also have a couple friends who I recommended Streamlit to and I didn't have to do a lot of convincing. I just told them about it, and a day later, they came back and knew how to use it. The only tip is to sign up on the forums, and if you have any questions, just ask or reach out to us in any way. There are lots of helpful people on the forums. There are, as I said, lots of people within Streamlit whose job is to interact with developers. </p>
			<p>The more <a id="_idIndexMarker463"/>complicated stuff, like cache and state, is<a id="_idIndexMarker464"/> not easy to get for beginners and needs some explanation, which we are also working a lot on right now. </p>
			<p>(Tyler) Thanks, Johannes, for coming and talking to us; I'm sure people got a lot out of this. Johannes's personal site can be found at <a href="https://www.jrieke.com/">https://www.jrieke.com/</a>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-131"><a id="_idTextAnchor134"/>Interview #3 – Adrien Treuille</h1>
			<p>(Tyler) Hey, Adrien! Thanks<a id="_idIndexMarker465"/> for being willing<a id="_idIndexMarker466"/> to be interviewed for this. Before we really get started, do you want to tell me a little bit about yourself? I know you were a professor at Carnegie Mellon, and before that you were working with protein folding. You've also worked on self-driving cars, and now are the founder of Streamlit. So how do you introduce yourself?</p>
			<p>(Adrien) First of all, when I was a professor, this whole Python data stack was kind of new. NumPy was certainly pre 1.0, and there was kind of this revelation that there was this amazing library called NumPy, all of a sudden, that made Python as good as MATLAB, and then after a while, way was better than MATLAB. That was the beginning of Python becoming the dominant language of numerical computation, and then ultimately machine learning. Python was a scripting language, a sysadmin language, or maybe a CS 101 language. All of a sudden it had this massive, new, super important industrial application. It started off with a bunch of nerds and professors using it in research, and they found that it was actually very useful, and much easier than writing our own machine learning code or numerical code in C. </p>
			<p>The other thing I was doing was creating computer games that allowed people to develop scientific problems, and eventually, millions of people played them. Fast forward a bit, and I went to work at Google. I had a really interesting, cool career at the intersection of tech and machine learning.</p>
			<p>Then I started Streamlit. We're building tools that are grounded in that numerical Python stack we were using 15 years ago (before it was cool). The other part of Streamlit is building a community. I think that aspect of Streamlit is very special. These two themes from my research have come full circle: the numerical Python world and the building of online communities. </p>
			<p>(Tyler) In the original documentation from October 2019 and the Medium posts thereafter, Streamlit was originally pitched as a tool for machine learning engineers. Now, you see all different types of people using it. I'm not an ML engineer, but I use it all the time. How has the idea of Streamlit changed over time?</p>
			<p>(Adrien) At a meta level, I'll say very genuinely that it's very cool for you to observe that. For us inside<a id="_idIndexMarker467"/> Streamlit, there are little, subtle<a id="_idIndexMarker468"/> shifts in how we talk about our targer user profile. But it doesn't necessarily feel like anyone else is paying attention to these subtle shifts. It's kind of cool to see someone else notice it!</p>
			<p>There are a couple of ways to answer this. Streamlit is more fundamental to Python programming than it is to machine learning or data science. It fulfills a need in Python programming that didn't exist in any other tool. You could write command-line scripts. There are also Python GUI frameworks, but those are quite intricate to use because GUI app development is a totally different style of programming than data work. You could go into a Jupyter notebook, but then it was, again, a totally different style of programming.</p>
			<p>Streamlit is a mashup of GUI programming and scripting. To me, that's a very useful thing. It actually transcends machine learning, as such. So part of the potential for Streamlit, for example, is to play a role in CS 101. One of the cool things about Streamlit is that there's this idea of the technology, and then there's the idea of how we are applying that to different problems and spaces. How do we prioritize applications for the community's benefit and also to create a sustainable company?</p>
			<p>(Tyler) I want to talk a bit more about the community you just mentioned, because you have built a ton of online games<a id="_idIndexMarker469"/> before, like FoldIt (<a href="https://fold.it/">https://fold.it/</a>), which has a strong crowdsourcing function to it. There are two sides to Streamlit in my mind. One side is very community-focused. It's an open source language on top of which anyone can build, and there are Streamlit components that can be made and added easily. The other side is the company Streamlit, which obviously exists to eventually turn a profit. How do you manage those two sides?</p>
			<p>(Adrien) I don't feel like we have to choose. When two things are aligned in their interests, everybody wins. From a business model standpoint, we are trying to put this software out into the world which has lots of use cases in data science. For example, I wrote a computer game for my son's class in Streamlit to help them understand multiplication. It also has a bunch of industrial applications. These two groups are aligned: the more people who are in the community and are contributing to Streamlit, the more our addressable user base grows for those industrial applications.</p>
			<p>It's a funnel. Data scientists funnel into Streamlit's open source community, which then flows into our customer base. We try to grow at every stage of the funnel, which is good both for the business model and the community.  </p>
			<p>(Tyler) What <a id="_idIndexMarker470"/>did you learn from your decade<a id="_idIndexMarker471"/> building online crowdsource games that you've brought into the Streamlit world? Because the community feels like a meta-game where people are trying to create cool Streamlit apps for other people. How do you nurture that? Is that intentional, or just a function of it being a cool tool?</p>
			<p>(Adrien) One interesting similarity between FoldIt and Streamlit is that they're both designed to be toy-like. A "toy" – which is a technical term in game design – is a game without rules that you just want to play with. There's no instruction manual for a GI Joe. It's just something you play by making it do stuff. You can add rules too, but you don't have to. </p>
			<p>Here's another game-like aspect of Streamlit: people building Streamlit apps and put them online to communicate ideas, and show off work, and gain praise. That helps others learn about Streamlit who then build more apps and further grow the community. We realized, "Wow, this cycle of publishing and praise is an amazing growth vector for us." We have made some effort to support the people who are putting their work out there, but I don't think we've really explored most of what's possible with this aspect of Streamlit. We just haven't had time to execute on it, because there are so many important things to do.</p>
			<p>(Tyler) If we're talking about company prioritization, how do you think about the priority of the company right now? You talked about the funnel, so then there are three main sections, the data scientists, the data scientists who use Streamlit, and then the data scientists who use Streamlit inside their company. Where's the focus of Streamlit at the moment?</p>
			<p>(Adrien) There is actually one more stage, which is how many people are viewing the apps created inside those companies, because our present pricing plan is based on viewership, not the number of developers. It's some number of dollars per viewer per month. </p>
			<p>So the way we prioritize focuses on another level of that pipeline. </p>
			<p>We called the first year after launch "the year of the developer," and it was about growing the open-source community. Going through exponential growth lead to discontinuous changes in operations. We weren't prepared for that. We put the entire engineering team on rotation answering questions in the community forums. They gave super well-informed answers, but the engineering team literally ground to a halt for three months. Then we realized, oh shoot, we can't hire engineers to solve our community problems.</p>
			<p>The second<a id="_idIndexMarker472"/> year, which we're in now, is "the year <a id="_idIndexMarker473"/>of the customer." This is all about building that initial monetization engine and creating a self-serve mechanism so that you can basically be a Streamlit user, click a button, and have Streamlit for Teams. We're not there yet, but all the pieces are coming together! </p>
			<p>(Tyler) A lot of people who are going to be reading this are going to be just starting out with their Python development, or they might be in the beginner/intermediate stage of learning Python and data science. They have quite a few other options to choose from, from Django or Flask to no-code tools, to other dashboarding frameworks. They could even switch over to R's Shiny app development. What is your pithy pitch to new users? Why Streamlit?</p>
			<p>(Adrien) I'd say you should just try it. There's a lot of sentiment on Twitter around how "cool" Streamlit is. I think it is powerful and cool. Streamlit is grounded in this idea of scripting, which is a very natural and simple paradigm for thinking about dataflow. I don't think anyone else really does that. It should feel kind of magical; coding isn't actually magic, but it's very fun. Super highly educated and incredibly well-paid people make apps just because it's fun, so we enjoy coming at it with that perspective. You should feel like you're getting more back than you spent typing each function call, and if that's the kind of emotional thing you get, then it's exciting to go through this. </p>
			<p>(Tyler) In my view, I started because it's easy, and then stayed because it's the best, you know?</p>
			<p>(Adrien) I think something that's true (and maybe I'm wrong about this) is that there's a lot in this visualization/dashboarding app/development space, where the more you know how they work and the deeper you get into them, the more disappointed you are. The demos you see look customizable and seem great, but when you actually go through the experience of building or trying to replicate the demo, it's very, very hard to actually achieve this thing that they're promising on their websites. </p>
			<p>That's just not true of Streamlit. When you look at all of the demo apps in the gallery (<a href="https://streamlit.io/gallery">https://streamlit.io/gallery</a>), they're really quite accessible. We're not trying to compete in the "Let's build a massive, perfect app" space.</p>
			<p>(Tyler) Thanks<a id="_idIndexMarker474"/> for coming and talking <a id="_idIndexMarker475"/>to us! The main thing that we should point to is obviously the central Streamlit website (<a href="https://streamlit.io/">https://streamlit.io/</a>).

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-132"><a id="_idTextAnchor135"/>Interview #4 – Charly Wargnier</h1>
			<p>(Tyler) Hey, Charly! Thanks<a id="_idIndexMarker476"/> so much for<a id="_idIndexMarker477"/> coming and talking to us. To start off, can you introduce yourself to the readers?</p>
			<p>(Charly) Hey there! I'm French and have been living in the UK for about 13 years now. And I've been doing mainly<a id="_idIndexMarker478"/> digital marketing, business intelligence, and <strong class="bold">SEO</strong> (<strong class="bold">Search Engine Optimization</strong>) consulting here in the UK. In the last few years, I have pivoted toward data engineering and data science. Also, I've worked both in-house and on the agency side, and for large companies in retail fashion and at a large range of small businesses as well. But since 2014, it has mainly been enterprises, and the time between 2008 and 2014 was with small businesses. </p>
			<p>(Tyler) Let's back up for a half-second; what is it like working in SEO? What does that actually look like?</p>
			<p>(Charly) My core skill set is mainly technical SEO. SEO is a vast territory, as you may imagine, and my core skill is with anything regarding the technicalities of a website, the way it has been coded, or the way it is being crawled or being passed by web crawlers. To make sure that Google and Bing can actually crawl these large websites accurately. Obviously, there's a lot of things involved in that, like making sure that paid search is in synergy with SEO. </p>
			<p>It's a very versatile kind of job where you have to liaise with not only the SEO people, but also the people developing the website, and even the PR, content, and product people as well. In terms of interactions, that's one of the most versatile jobs around.</p>
			<p>(Tyler) Got it, that all makes sense. Another thing we haven't mentioned yet is Streamlit. You use Streamlit quite a bit and are a prolific creator. What is it about Streamlit that makes it so valuable of a tool for you?</p>
			<p>(Charly) I used to work a lot providing some Python scripts to people via Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook. And since I've been using Streamlit, I no longer have to send over scripts; I can just literally send those apps! And I can show them some SEO apps or functionality that they wouldn't have been able to use unless they were a developer. It really widens <a id="_idIndexMarker479"/>the scope and the user adoption. And <a id="_idIndexMarker480"/>in the few companies I've worked with in the last few months, I've been able to bring way more people to start using the SEO apps that I have been designing. There has been a big, big shift. </p>
			<p>(Tyler) How interesting! The other option for you in Python is to make Flask for Django applications; did you ever think about doing something like that for SEO apps? </p>
			<p>(Charly) Yeah, I did develop some Flask applications back in the day, but it was quite cumbersome for me to develop that because it requires a lot of skills in HTML or JavaScript. But with Streamlit, it has really enabled me to create something very quickly and to share that with people. So no Flask, and I have tried a bit of Django but the learning curve is actually quite steep. It usually takes me ages to design anything in Django. So yeah, there's literally no comparison; I've left Flask and Django aside for now and I'm really prioritizing Streamlit. </p>
			<p>(Tyler) Totally agree, I've made a bunch of different data science projects pre-Streamlit and my two options always were to put it in a Jupyter notebook or blog post or make a fully fledged app in Flask. The issue for me used to be that the difference in time and effort to make an entire app, before Streamlit, was way too high. It would double the time on the project! And with Streamlit, it is just a little bit more difficult than making a Jupyter notebook but the output is so much better. </p>
			<p>(Charly) I'm trying to learn React at the moment, so I can make something a bit more integrated and polished and use Streamlit as an MVP. So I have used some other web frameworks, but you're right. With regards to quickness, nothing to this day beats Streamlit. I think the closest<a id="_idIndexMarker481"/> one is Panel (<a href="https://panel.holoviz.org/">https://panel.holoviz.org/</a>), which is flexible and pretty straightforward, but I think that the big difference between Streamlit and Panel is the community. The Streamlit community has been so welcoming, including yourself and other people too. Even a few years ago, I was barely coding anything in Python and Streamlit is really the application that I've embraced. I think the community is really key.</p>
			<p>(Tyler) Speaking of community, you have been really involved with both the SEO and the Streamlit communities. You've created apps like StreamEA (<a href="https://www.charlywargnier.com/post/streamea-entity-analyzer">https://www.charlywargnier.com/post/streamea-entity-analyzer</a>), which extracts and analyzes entities from web pages; how do you come up with apps like these? Are you solving your own problems and then turning that into an app, or taking older Python scripts from older clients and turning those into apps?</p>
			<p>(Charly) So it's<a id="_idIndexMarker482"/> really a mix of different things. You've<a id="_idIndexMarker483"/> quoted quite a few there. First of all, I'm solving issues I'm having myself, as I've been doing SEO for years so I've regularly bumped into SEO issues and the idea is to solve these by creating an app so others can use the solution as well. I've always been fascinated by web applications; I remember as far back as 2013 where I had a bit of a geeky dream to develop web apps! The other thing that you're right about is that I have a lot of Jupyter notebooks and scripts that I have been using for years, and speaking of user adoption, I wanted to make sure anyone could try them out. </p>
			<p>I usually also collect feedback within my companies or from the clients that I've worked for, so I get a lot of user feedback. And sometimes also it is just stumbling upon some new libraries online that I am curious about, just like yourself. The final thing is the paid aspect; there are a lot of SEO options on the market that can be pretty expensive. And I think one of my secret desires, if I may say, is to be able to kind of make those apps available for free. It's my guilty pleasure to take an application that people would pay hundreds or thousands of pounds a month for and recreate it with Python for free. It's a nice satisfaction to have! </p>
			<p>(Tyler) I'd love to talk about StreamEA a little bit more, can you talk a bit about any developmental difficulties you had with creating that app? What was that process like? </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer125" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16864_12_3.jpg" alt="Figure 12.3 – StreamEA&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.3 – StreamEA</p>
			<p>(Charly) Well, entity analysis is a hot topic in the SEO world. Google has been shifting from pure keywords to different kinds of semantic advancements, like, for example, entities. As<a id="_idIndexMarker484"/> Google is putting some ranking value<a id="_idIndexMarker485"/> or some weight toward those entities, you want to make sure that your pages or your websites are targeting those entities accurately. </p>
			<p>In terms of challenges, there's quite a bit of code, but it wasn't necessarily too challenging. The Google Natural Language API is pretty straightforward. So the way the app is built, you get two main parts, the scraping bits with BeautifulSoup and the entity analysis bits with the API. The difficulty here is that by default, the Natural Language API retrieves some data and you need to create some function that would convert back and forth between dictionaries and data frames, which was a bit of a challenge because when I started last August, my Python knowledge wasn't necessarily great. And I remember struggling with that a lot, to be able to take the API from Google in a way that worked with my data frame. Now, it would be a piece of cake, but I remember it was a bit of a bottleneck and a learning experience for me. </p>
			<p>And then you've got a little budget estimator, because the Google NLP API can be pricey if left untamed! A lot of people are scraping Wikipedia, which can have very long pages, so I thought that having this kind of little budget estimator, which estimates the cost for using StreamEA (StreamEA has you upload your own Google API credentials), would be useful. </p>
			<p>Recently, I have open sourced another application, which does entity relationship retrieval from Wikipedia URLs. I haven't put any budget estimates on it yet, and people have been a bit grumpy with me, which is why I put a warning on it. It not only scrapes the Wikipedia URLs you input, but it also scrapes any children pages, which can go crazy without limits. The other day, some people were pushing the application to the max with scripting, for example, 100 children from the master page, which was fantastically long. And they were charged hundreds of pounds from Google!</p>
			<p>(Tyler) That's the one thing that I've recommended to people at the very beginning when you're setting up your AWS or GCP accounts, that you should absolutely set the budget limit to what you can afford so they turn your services off before you spend anywhere close to that amount of money.  </p>
			<p>So you kind of got started in Python and Streamlit around the same time, do you have any tips for beginners<a id="_idIndexMarker486"/> getting started in Streamlit? Are there things that you kind of wish you would<a id="_idIndexMarker487"/> have known when you first started? </p>
			<p>(Charly) I started with Python in 2016 or 2017, where I was literally going to GitHub, taking some scripts, and not doing anything to them. Just using Python without necessarily understanding what the stuff was about. And then I started learning online with Jupyter Notebook, and eventually I had this opportunity to start building some web apps. </p>
			<p>But to come back to your question, my advice that I would give to new users is to lean on the community. With Streamlit, I think that sets us apart. I would say don't be too shy! People are so helpful there, they will certainly try to help out. And also don't be scared to share anything; embrace Twitter for sharing information with others. Don't be afraid to share your projects and your progress, not just the end product; there is no such thing as an end product anyway. I really have worked in a vacuum, working for myself, and if you don't share your work, then you don't get this good emotional push from the feedback from the community. </p>
			<p>It will never be perfect; you will never be ready. So just release it early; release it often! If there are a few issues with the app, don't worry about it. Just caveat it in your tweet or your post, and people will understand that. I mean, besides, your tool is a free tool. So people can't be too demanding.</p>
			<p>(Tyler) When I first started developing and doing data science work in school, I would never share anything because I was so nervous that it wouldn't be good enough compared to all the professionals out there. So I would make all this stuff and never show it to anyone because I didn't feel like it was good enough. And then once I figured out that wasn't going to work and I started to share more of my projects, it was just so much better, so much more fun. </p>
			<p>(Charly) You've released a lot of projects over the years, it's really great. It's pretty impressive.</p>
			<p>(Tyler) Thank you! Do you have any other things you would like to plug that you're working on?</p>
			<p>(Charly) Oh, yeah, as you can imagine there are many things on the grill right now. I kind of started <a id="_idIndexMarker488"/>some of them around 2 years ago <a id="_idIndexMarker489"/>but as a script or a notebook, and I'm slowly converting them to Streamlit apps. I want to turn StreamEA into a paid app that is way more useful for SEO. I also have some machine learning apps in the pipeline, which I'm hopefully planning to release soon.</p>
			<p>(Tyler) Thank you so much for coming and talking to us! You can find Charly on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/DataChaz">https://twitter.com/DataChaz</a>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-133"><a id="_idTextAnchor136"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>This concludes <a href="B16864_12_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor131"><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em></a>, <em class="italic">Streamlit Power Users</em>, and also the book! We covered so much deep content in this chapter, from talking about the importance of community development with Fanilo to some practical examples of popular applications with Johannes, and even discussing the toy-like features of Streamlit and where Streamlit is heading next with Adrien. We got a brief history lesson of where Streamlit has come from over the past couple of years (2019 and 2020), heard about the SEO ecosystem from Charly, and learned tips and tricks along the way. Some of my favorite tips are to join and post on the forums from Fanilo, to put Streamlit apps online that you think would be interesting from Johannes, and to lean in to the toy-like aspects of Streamlit from Adrien. </p>
			<p>I just want to say thank you for reading this book; it has been a labor of love for me and I would like nothing better than for you to reach out to me and let me know how it has affected your Streamlit developer experience. You can find me on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/tylerjrichards">https://twitter.com/tylerjrichards</a>, and I hope you have had as good of a time reading this book as I have writing it. Thank you and go make some awesome Streamlit apps!</p>
