  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Bioinformatics is an active research field that uses a range of simple-to-advanced
    computations to extract valuable information from biological data, and this book
    will show you how to manage these tasks using Python.

- en: This updated edition of the Bioinformatics with Python Cookbook begins with
    a quick overview of the various tools and libraries in the Python ecosystem that
    will help you convert, analyze, and visualize biological datasets. As you advance
    through the chapters, you’ll cover key techniques for next-generation sequencing,
    single-cell analysis, genomics, metagenomics, population genetics, phylogenetics,
    and proteomics with the help of real-world examples. You’ll learn how to work
    with important pipeline systems, such as Galaxy servers and Snakemake, and understand
    the various modules in Python for functional and asynchronous programming. This
    book will also help you explore topics such as SNP discovery using statistical
    approaches under high-performance computing frameworks, including Dask and Spark,
    and the application of machine learning algorithms to bioinformatics.

  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for bioinformatics analysts, data scientists, computational biologists,
    researchers, and Python developers who want to address intermediate-to-advanced
    biological and bioinformatics problems. Working knowledge of the Python programming
    language is expected. Basic knowledge of biology would be helpful.

- en: '[*Chapter 5*](B17942_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor122)*, Working with Genomes*, not
    only deals with high-quality references—such as the human genome—but also discusses
    how to analyze other low-quality references typical in nonmodel species. It introduces
    GFF processing, teaches you to analyze genomic feature information, and discusses
    how to use gene ontologies.'

    introduces two types of pipelines. The first type of pipeline is Python-based
    Galaxy, a widely used system with a web interface targeting mostly non-programming
    users although bioinformaticians might still have to interact with it programmatically.
    The second type will be based on snakemake and nextflow, a type of pipeline that
    targets programmers.'
