    data governance (in addition to data governance in general). The root of this
    question is: how do you measure the value in terms that business users will understand
    *and agree to*? The important part of this answer is that the business user must
    agree that the value they received is as you described. Most CDAOs do not go the
    extra step to gather confirmation from the business that they did indeed receive
    the value the data office says that they did. In this case, CDAOs are found advocating

    without being defensive. If the assumptions don’t make sense to the business,

    simply, the breadth and depth of your data lineage capability is the primary indicator
    of success. As you start to roll out this capability, you may start with a single
    report or metric. Next, you may evolve to an entire data domain or suite of systems.
    Last, you may have all prioritized data assets across the company documented with
    sustainable data lineage. As you mature, you should be able to uncover problems
    and errors in your data lineage through validation. Validation is a best practice
    that should be implemented along your maturity journey. The validation should
    include connecting data supplies and data consumers to confirm the results are
    as expected. Let’s explore validation deeper.

    the business understanding, and it’s based on a series of assumptions about the
    data. In reality, what we should do is clarify the outcome we are searching for
    before we start asking for access to any data. Starting with “*Why?*” results
    in a much more specific and faster outcome. It allows the requester to think more
    deeply about why they are doing what they are doing and enables the data team
    to support them with a faster path to that answer because it is based on what
    they need versus where they want to start their search. This “give me access”
    approach is based on the assumption that the requester knows the location they
    are requesting access to is the best place to get the most trustworthy version

    Data Marketplace (see [*Chapter 6*](B18846_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor134), *Metadata

- en: Now that we understand more about data lineage, what it looks like, who is involved,
    and the benefits, let’s explore how to build an optimal data lineage capability
    for your organization. First, you need to assess the complexity of your organization.
    Are you a large, highly regulated industry or are you a small, single-product
    company? Not every organization will need a fully robust, state-of-the-art data
    lineage. You may also start by building data lineage manually to prove the capability
    before investing hundreds of thousands, if not more, into a more robust tool.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Prioritize the scope of your implementation. Begin with a single report or single
    metric as a pilot and prove the capability. Gather a small group of individuals
    who are a part of the production of this report and help them understand the value
    of understanding the journey of data across the organization to produce their
    report or metric. Trace the data’s journey, identify opportunities for simplicity
    and remediation of issues, and measure the quality of the data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Show the benefits of the pilot widely across the organization. Better yet, have
    the report or metric owner tell this story on your behalf. Have them share how
    their job has been simplified and/or improved because of this capability. Your
    next challenge will be to prioritize those who will step forward, wanting the
    same benefits seen in the pilot.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As you work to deploy a strong technical metadata capability within your organization,
    it helps to work in concert with your business metadata capability. As you are
    working to progress this capability across programs or data domains, having your
    data catalog updated as you go, defining key data elements, and aligning with
    technical metadata, including lineage, will help you build confidence in the quality
    of both business and technical metadata. Being able to show your users that you
    have both business and technical depth of understanding that is reliable will
    translate into strong reliance on your capabilities. Remember to start by defining
    the scope to help set expectations regarding what the business will get from this
    capability, and when. Ensure you have clear roles and responsibilities, along
    with clear, transparent, and published metrics to measure your success. Lastly,
    don’t forget to tell stories of success as you go.
