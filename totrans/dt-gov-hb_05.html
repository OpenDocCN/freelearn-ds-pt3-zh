			<h1 id="_idParaDest-112"><a id="_idTextAnchor111"/>Defining Success and Aligning on Outcomes</h1>
			<p>Data management is bigger than managing a maturity framework. Managing a framework only focuses on the tactics to uplift a score. It may or may not drive the experience of using data, trusting data, and overall data management uplift. We need to approach data management with a renewed focus and a fresh set of eyes. We need to build foundational capabilities that scale without doubling the size of our teams as the amount of data doubles every few years. I challenge you to think beyond the maturity framework (although important), into the minds of <span class="No-Break">your stakeholders.</span></p>
			<p>Picture this: You’ve launched a Data &amp; Analytics team. Your team is excited, they are focused, and you’ve even built out a great strategy, easy-to-understand policies, and specific milestones for delivering great results. You execute against that plan and are knocking the delivery out of <span class="No-Break">the park.</span></p>
			<p>There’s just <span class="No-Break">one problem.</span></p>
			<p><em class="italic">No one believes that the team is </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">adding value</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>How can this be? You spent time listening to stakeholders’ needs; you crafted a plan that is shaped around delivering against those needs. You’ve set up a strong program with great communication channels, yet the feedback from stakeholders is: this doesn’t really <span class="No-Break">help me.</span></p>
			<p><em class="italic">What </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">went wrong?</em></span></p>
			<p>This oh-so-common problem happens frequently in data transformations and in the build of data capabilities when the crisp and clear alignment of expected business outcomes is not firmly aligned and signed off on by the business users before the work begins. Unfortunately, this type of scenario happens regularly, and the only remedy is defining success and aligning on outcomes during the <span class="No-Break">planning phase.</span></p>
			<p>This chapter will focus on the area where many data transformations fall flat: aligning on outcomes that matter to the business. Most data transformations stop with data outcomes and fail to translate to the final mile: where the business uses the delivered data capabilities to drive operational efficiency, increased revenues, and better insights. In this chapter, you will learn why defining success beyond data and with the business matters, how to successfully map all relevant stakeholders (including secondary and tertiary stakeholders), and how to translate results into <span class="No-Break">business terms.</span></p>
			<p>This chapter covers the <span class="No-Break">following topics:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Capabilities <span class="No-Break">versus outcomes</span></li>
				<li>Business outcomes <em class="italic">AND</em> <span class="No-Break">data capabilities</span></li>
				<li>What <span class="No-Break">is success?</span></li>
				<li>Aligning <span class="No-Break">on outcomes</span></li>
				<li>Barriers to achieving <span class="No-Break">business value</span></li>
				<li>Building value measures into your <span class="No-Break">stakeholder map</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-113"><a id="_idTextAnchor112"/>Capabilities versus outcomes</h1>
			<p>Before we can define success, we need to start by grounding ourselves on a few key definitions. First, we need to define what a capability and<a id="_idIndexMarker313"/> an outcome are, and then slice that between business and <span class="No-Break">data flavors:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Capability</strong>: The ability or capacity to do something and achieve a <span class="No-Break">desired outcome.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Outcome</strong>: The final result or <a id="_idIndexMarker314"/>consequence of an event or situation. This can be a positive or <span class="No-Break">negative outcome.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Keep in mind that capabilities have outcomes. For each capability, a single or collection of outcomes should be prescribed. Before beginning to deliver the capability, you should take time to define the expected outcomes. But if you haven’t, it’s never too late to define the outcomes expected for each capability. You may also have expected outcomes and unexpected outcomes. For example, I exercised today, and I expect to experience muscle soreness tomorrow. I did not expect to be so sore it would hurt <span class="No-Break">to walk.</span></p>
			<p>Now, let’s make this clearer to <a id="_idIndexMarker315"/>delineate between business capabilities and outcomes versus data capabilities <span class="No-Break">and outcomes:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Business capability</strong>: Defines “what” the<a id="_idIndexMarker316"/> business does at the core. This is separated from “how” things are done or “where” they are done. It contains a set of<a id="_idIndexMarker317"/> skills, resources, and processes that enable a company to meet <span class="No-Break">an objective.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Business outcome</strong>: Defines the result of the<a id="_idIndexMarker318"/> capability. This includes deeply understanding the result of delivering <span class="No-Break">the capability.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data capability</strong>: Defines the combined <a id="_idIndexMarker319"/>skills, processes, technologies, and resources that an organization pulls together to utilize data to achieve a <span class="No-Break">specific objective.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data outcome</strong>: Defines the result of the <a id="_idIndexMarker320"/>data capability. This refers to the result or consequence (positive or negative) that is achieved through the delivery of a <span class="No-Break">data capability.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Because we are most concerned about data capabilities, let’s dig into what the key components of data capabilities are before we move into data outcomes later in <span class="No-Break">this chapter.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-114"><a id="_idTextAnchor113"/>Capabilities</h2>
			<p>Specific data capabilities will be described in further detail in <em class="italic">Part 2</em> of this book, following this chapter; however, let’s start by clarifying what makes up a <span class="No-Break">strong capability:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong class="bold">Skills and knowledge</strong>: This includes the<a id="_idIndexMarker321"/> expertise of data professionals such as data analysts, data scientists, and data engineers. It also encompasses the data literacy of general users across the organization who need to understand and utilize <span class="No-Break">data effectively.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Processes and methodologies</strong>: This involves established procedures for data governance, data quality management, data collection, data analysis, and data security. Standardized processes ensure consistency, efficiency, and reliability in handling data throughout its <span class="No-Break">life cycle.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Technologies and tools</strong>: This encompasses the hardware, software, and infrastructure needed to manage and analyze data. This can include data warehouses, data lakes, data visualization tools, analytics platforms, and various software applications specific to <a id="_idIndexMarker322"/>data management <span class="No-Break">and analysis.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Resources</strong>: This includes financial resources allocated for data initiatives, infrastructure maintenance, and personnel dedicated to data management and analysis. Effective data capability requires adequate resources to support the necessary processes, technologies, <span class="No-Break">and personnel.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Cultural aspects</strong>: This refers to an organizational culture that values data, encourages data-driven decision-making, and fosters collaboration between different departments in utilizing data effectively. A data-driven culture is crucial for maximizing the adoption and utilization of data capabilities across <span class="No-Break">the organization.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Together, these components make<a id="_idIndexMarker323"/> up a strong data capability. Each part is independently required and must be strong in aggregate to produce a high-quality, trustworthy data capability. Without all components, companies will struggle to have success <em class="italic">OR</em> align on outcomes. Overall, a well-developed data capability empowers organizations to do <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Gain deeper insights from their data</strong>: By effectively analyzing and interpreting data, organizations can uncover hidden patterns, trends, and opportunities <span class="No-Break">for improvement</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Make data-driven decisions</strong>: Utilizing reliable and insightful data allows organizations to make informed decisions based on evidence, leading to improved efficiency, effectiveness, and <span class="No-Break">competitive advantage</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Optimize operations and processes</strong>: Data-driven insights can help identify areas for improvement, streamline processes, and optimize resource allocation for <span class="No-Break">better performance</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Enhance customer experience</strong>: Analyzing customer data can help understand customer behavior, preferences, and needs, leading to improved product development, marketing strategies, and overall <span class="No-Break">customer experience</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Developing a strong data<a id="_idIndexMarker324"/> capability is no small feat, and it requires continuous improvement and adaptation as technologies and business needs evolve. However, by investing in the necessary skills, processes, technologies, and resources and fostering a data-driven culture, organizations can unlock the immense potential of their data and gain a competitive edge in today’s <span class="No-Break">data-driven world.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-115"><a id="_idTextAnchor114"/>Outcomes</h2>
			<p>As we’ve clarified what it takes to build strong capabilities, what comes next is getting very clear on outcomes. As I articulated<a id="_idIndexMarker325"/> earlier, outcomes are what the business experiences as a result of the capability. It answers one of my favorite questions: <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">So what?</em></span></p>
			<p>My teams know this question well because it’s one of my favorites to use, to help us get to the specific answer around what the outcome really is and what it means for the business. For example, imagine you are working on the <span class="No-Break">following situation:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Goal</strong>: Get <span class="No-Break">in shape</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Capability</strong></span><span class="No-Break">: Running</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Outcome</strong>: Complete a 5k in under <span class="No-Break">30 minutes</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Most goals fail when we do not get specific about the capability required and the outcome we are expecting. If we take this same framing and apply it to a data capability, it may look something <span class="No-Break">like this:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Goal</strong>: Ensure the company knows what data it has, where it is stored, how it is classified, and who is accountable <span class="No-Break">for it</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Capabilities</strong>: Near-real-time metadata (business and technical), AI-powered classification, and data stewardship, as well as a <span class="No-Break">data catalog</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Outcome</strong>: Searchable data environment to enable customer contract obligations and to identify their data in<a id="_idIndexMarker326"/> your ecosystem, with <strong class="bold">points of contact</strong> (<strong class="bold">POCs</strong>) within <span class="No-Break">24 hours</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Note in both examples there is <a id="_idIndexMarker327"/>more than one capability that could support the goal, but when you take into consideration the outcome required, the capability has fewer options and you can be more focused on what you need to generate success. In the next section, I will build on how to marry business outcomes with data capabilities for more powerful alignment between your business stakeholders and your <span class="No-Break">data team.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-116"><a id="_idTextAnchor115"/>Business outcomes and data capabilities</h1>
			<p>Traditional data capabilities are managed from within IT departments, which is part of why they have historically not been as successful. IT measures of success are typically framed as project-based measures, such <a id="_idIndexMarker328"/>as meeting milestones, or in budget/time measures, dollars or hours saved. This early generation of data capability management inevitably<a id="_idIndexMarker329"/> led to difficult-to-measure-and-quantify outcomes, which is the basis of the evolution from IT outcomes toward business outcome-focused measurement <span class="No-Break">of success.</span></p>

							<p>If you continue to measure data capabilities in a traditional, legacy IT (project-based) way or exclusively budget/time, you may find that you create a conflict of interest between your business stakeholders and <span class="No-Break">your incentives.</span></p>
							<p>Often, your stakeholders need to have business outcomes that may not improve speed or budget but actually use an increase in budget to drive an increase in something else that is meaningful (for example, revenue, customer success scores, or <span class="No-Break">lead identification).</span></p>

			<p>You need to set up your outcome<a id="_idIndexMarker330"/> framework based on both business outcomes and data outcomes.

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Table 5.2 – Example of second-level business outcome</p>
			<p>If you pitched the first-level example to your company and asked for funding, it would be pretty difficult to align on success. Why? Because it reads like you won’t be successful until you have metadata for the entire company, you classify all data in the company, you have all <a id="_idIndexMarker334"/>stewards identified, and you have a fully populated <span class="No-Break">data catalog.</span></p>
			<p>However, if you go back to the business outcome, which is more specific than the goal, you have a much more specific data capability to meet that outcome. This is far more ideal, focused, and has a far higher probability of <strong class="bold">success</strong>, which is the topic of our <span class="No-Break">next section.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-118"><a id="_idTextAnchor117"/>What is success?</h1>
			<p>Now that you’ve zeroed in on what <a id="_idIndexMarker335"/>success is (reminder: it’s focused on the business outcome), you can work with your business stakeholders to define success. In our previous example, we aligned with our business stakeholders on a single outcome that was met by the implementation of four key data capabilities. In our example, these capabilities are focused on the customer <span class="No-Break">data domain.</span></p>
			<p>To be successful, you must ensure that you have a narrow enough focus so that you can define a simple and<a id="_idIndexMarker336"/> straightforward <strong class="bold">definition of done</strong>. A definition of done is best to describe success when it is specific and measurable (you may like to use the commonly known SMARTER framework<a id="_idIndexMarker337"/> to assist you with this). Ideally, you should take each of these data capabilities and define what it will take to deliver a capability <span class="No-Break">of value.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-119"><a id="_idTextAnchor118"/>What is the definition of value?</h2>
			<p>Value is defined by the shareholder; therefore, until <a id="_idIndexMarker338"/>you have their sign-off on the value provided to their business, what you believe is irrelevant. You can, and should, measure and produce the value measurement you believe you provided to your stakeholder; however, it should not be considered final until you both agree and will stand behind the results together. The worst-case scenario is when you have delivered a solution for the business and you believe it’s added value and they do not. It will undermine your <span class="No-Break">credibility instantly.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s keep pulling on the previous example. How do you define success, in light of value that the business will <span class="No-Break">agree to?</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-120"><a id="_idTextAnchor119"/>Defining success</h2>
			<p>Starting with the business<a id="_idIndexMarker339"/> outcome, start by defining a set of core metrics that will measure value for the business, in terms <span class="No-Break">they understand:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Align on the overall <span class="No-Break">business outcome.</span></li>
				<li>Define and map data capabilities needed to achieve the <span class="No-Break">business outcome.</span></li>
				<li>Define what will need to be done for each data capability to deliver value in part and in aggregate (for <span class="No-Break">example, sub-milestones).</span></li>
				<li>Align on how you will <span class="No-Break">measure value.</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Deliver capabilities.</span></li>
				<li>Report <span class="No-Break">progress iteratively.</span></li>
				<li>Measure data capability success in <span class="No-Break">data outcomes.</span></li>
				<li>Measure data capability success in <span class="No-Break">business outcome(s).</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Together, these eight steps<a id="_idIndexMarker340"/> can be used to frame a strong delivery roadmap. Let’s break these eight steps into an actionable plan, using the <span class="No-Break">previous example.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-121"><a id="_idTextAnchor120"/>Aligning on outcomes</h1>
			<p>Let’s now break these eight steps into <a id="_idIndexMarker341"/>an actionable plan, using the previous example. These eight steps will explain how to, in specific detail, align with your business stakeholders. As you become more confident in this process, you will find it takes less time to complete this process. However, the first few times you go through it, you may find it takes a bit of time to map out. This would be a good process to work on with someone on your team or as a small team to ensure you capture all possible outcomes and work to refine them into a clear outcome prior to sharing them with your stakeholders for input and discussion. This is also a great process to work on with a stakeholder if they are open to collaborating more closely <span class="No-Break">with you.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-122"><a id="_idTextAnchor121"/>Step 1 – Aligning on the business outcome</h2>
			<p>Start by ensuring you and the business<a id="_idIndexMarker342"/> stakeholder (referred to as the business sponsor) are aligned on the business outcome they need, to support their business strategy. You may jointly <a id="_idIndexMarker343"/>write this outcome, or you might write it based on the listening sessions you conducted on your listening tour when you started out in the <span class="No-Break">data role.</span></p>
			<p>For the purposes of this section, I will present the components of this eight-step approach in a series of tables for easy reference. You can use this same format if it suits you for your <span class="No-Break">own company.</span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-123"><a id="_idTextAnchor122"/>Step 2 – Defining data capabilities</h2>
			<p>Next, you will define and recommend data capabilities you and/or your team will deliver to support the business outcome. This is a great opportunity for you to explain to your stakeholder what these capabilities<a id="_idIndexMarker344"/> are and why they are the right data capabilities to support their outcome. If you make the common mistake of simply providing a list of data capabilities to the stakeholder without explaining why they are the right capabilities, this is the first risk in your delivery. If the stakeholder does not fully understand and comprehend why these capabilities are the right ones to support their needs, this is where the first shred of doubt creeps in. The doubt may not manifest until later in the steps, but this is where you begin to lose them and your credibility. Do not skip this step.

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-125"><a id="_idTextAnchor124"/>Step 4 – Aligning on value measurement</h2>
			<p>Once you have defined the steps in delivering each capability, based on specific deliverables, your next step is to align <a id="_idIndexMarker348"/>on the measurement of the value delivered. This is another step that requires a very tight partnership with your business stakeholders. Since you’ve defined the plan to get there (including what needs to be delivered, and for each capability), it’s time to align that they agree with this approach, you answer any questions that they might have, and you affirm that once these capabilities are delivered, they will be able to meet the overall <span class="No-Break">business objective.</span></p>
			<p>In our previous example, the overall business objective was to meet customer contractual obligations, which was, essentially, to have their data well identified <span class="No-Break">and governed.</span></p>
			<p>Assume your company has 500 customers. Ensuring you are compliant with all 500 customer contractual obligations is critical to each of the customers’ contracts, given the agreement language is consistent. You can use the 500 to calculate an impact based on SLA violation in the contract (for example, let’s say the contract imposes a $10,000 fine for each violation). You can use the 500 customers * $10,000 per violation to determine the value of the impact to be $5,000,000. This is the value of the risk you are working <span class="No-Break">to mitigate.</span></p>

			<p>As you complete the delivery of the items in <em class="italic">step 5</em>, you should report progress to your stakeholders regularly.

This ensures your team is motivated to<a id="_idIndexMarker351"/> make meaningful progress regularly, and that the stakeholders remain fully engaged in sponsoring the work you are delivering for them.

			<p>After your team completes the delivery of the <a id="_idIndexMarker352"/>implementation (and, ideally, concurrently as you deliver each capability), you should measure the success of the delivery in terms of the data <a id="_idIndexMarker353"/>outcomes first. This is helpful for your own team and to ensure that, first and foremost, you have met the expectations of basic data delivery. After you ground yourself and your team in the data outcomes, you should immediately move to measure success in business outcomes and report on these two measures jointly (<em class="italic">steps 7</em> and <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">8</em></span><span class="No-Break"> together).</span></p>
			<p>Finally, if you find that your data outcomes <em class="italic">OR</em> your business outcomes deviate from your expected results, be transparent about the variance, seek to drive to the root cause as to why it varied from your expected results, and work to determine <span class="No-Break">the impact.</span></p>

			<p>From this point, you are ready to define success and align with your stakeholders – congratulations! Following this framework will enable you to successfully navigate specific and clear outcomes that matter to your stakeholders with ease. Remember to iterate through these steps so that you and your stakeholders are clear about expectations. Next, I will walk you through some barriers to success to be aware of as you operationalize <span class="No-Break">these steps.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-131"><a id="_idTextAnchor130"/>Barriers to achieving business value</h1>
			<p>After following the eight-step approach outlined previously, you have the strongest chances of success. However, there are always risks in delivering any program. I would be remiss not to point out the most <a id="_idIndexMarker359"/>common barriers <span class="No-Break">to success:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Organizational culture and/or politics</strong>: These are not always visible, and your chances of not fully understanding or seeing these risks are higher if you are new to the organization. It’s harder to understand the invisible network of how the company gets to a win if you are new. If you are new to the organization, ask how success is achieved. Seek to understand unspoken cultural ways to get work done in <span class="No-Break">your company.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Funding changes or challenges</strong>: Securing and maintaining funding, especially in multi-year implementations, can be a challenge. If you are working on a multi-year delivery, ensure you have a commitment to the entire program, not just <span class="No-Break">year 1.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Sponsorship turnover</strong>: People make professional moves. You have to assume that your project sponsor might not be in the same role (or the same company) for the duration of your project. If you do not ensure that you have support, go a layer or two below<a id="_idIndexMarker360"/> the sponsor to ensure you have <span class="No-Break">durable support.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Lack of support</strong>: You did not get the full support of a sponsor, or you only received support at a junior (or simply too junior) level. The person you gained support from may not have the authority to provide the support you need to drive results <span class="No-Break">to finality.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Lack of technical expertise</strong>: Perhaps your team did not have the technical expertise required to complete the work. You attempted to let too technical work be done by not technical enough experts, and the result is a <span class="No-Break">sub-par solution.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Regulatory or economic changes</strong>: A material change occurs either economically or in the regulatory environment that impacts the prioritization of <span class="No-Break">the project.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Drive unified data experiences internally and across our products to empower the organization and our customers with the right data at the right time with the right controls. Aim to achieve <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Tech-enabled governance</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Transparent metadata</span></li>
				<li>Unified and trusted consent (<span class="No-Break">for marketing)</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Trusted insights</span></li>
				<li>Results at scale <span class="No-Break">and speed</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now that we’ve covered potential barriers to success, we can pivot into how to add value measures to your stakeholder map. This is a fantastic but often overlooked step: consolidate the outcomes by stakeholder so that you can have a comprehensive view of all the work you’ve done to <a id="_idIndexMarker361"/>drive measurable business outcomes for each stakeholder you serve. You can then use this information in periodic reviews with your stakeholders (annual, bi-annual, or quarterly business reviews, depending on <span class="No-Break">your preferences).</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-132"><a id="_idTextAnchor131"/>Building value measures into your stakeholder map</h1>
			<p>As you work to build out your company’s <em class="italic">value measurement methodology</em> (like we did previously), for each project, you can start to build out what this value measurement and value map look like for all of your<a id="_idIndexMarker362"/> stakeholders. This process is time-consuming but critical to demonstrate the value of your team’s <span class="No-Break">impact enterprise-wide.</span></p>
			<p>Thinking back to <a href="B18846_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor042"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></span></a>, where we built out the stakeholder map, you can add in the value measurement methodology against each stakeholder group. A best practice is to sit with each stakeholder on a regular basis (I like to do this quarterly) to go through a <em class="italic">Quarterly Business Review</em> for the value your team has brought to bear for them. This idea of a Quarterly Business Review would walk them through <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>The scope of your engagement with <span class="No-Break">the stakeholder</span></li>
				<li>A list of discrete projects you have completed for them in the quarter (<span class="No-Break">or year)</span></li>
				<li>A list of enterprise services you provide to them (and <span class="No-Break">everyone else)</span></li>
				<li>The value measurement for the quarter (<span class="No-Break">or year)</span></li>
				<li>A look ahead to what is coming <span class="No-Break">next quarter</span></li>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.4 – Stakeholder map example: Sales division</p>
			<p>Remember when we looked at how the office of the CDAO was supporting these objectives? We lined out the direct impact from CDAO to Sales Operations to Sales and clearly articulated how each role <a id="_idIndexMarker363"/>was involved in delivering that value. We also grounded ourselves in how the CDAO team was thinking <span class="No-Break">about value.</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.5 – Value chain from data office to business and to customer</p>
			<p>Key measures include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li><em class="italic">How much</em> did <span class="No-Break">revenue increase?</span></li>
				<li><em class="italic">How much</em> productivity did<a id="_idIndexMarker364"/> the Sales team save by being able to rely on <span class="No-Break">this model?</span></li>
				<li><em class="italic">How much</em> did customer satisfaction scores shift by being sold products that they <span class="No-Break">actually want?</span></li>
				<li><em class="italic">How much</em> did customer <span class="No-Break">trust increase?</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>For this example, we would measure these specifically, as a part of our value measurement methodology, and present the results back to both Sales Operations and Sales executive leadership, to show them exactly how much we impacted their top and bottom lines, as well as customer satisfaction and overall customer <span class="No-Break">health scores.</span></p>
			<p>More advanced CDAO offices build their own value measurement dashboards to build out transparent and accessible reporting (ideally with the ability to drill into the details that support this aggregation, by stakeholder group) so that you can build trust with your stakeholders by showing (not just telling) them how you are bringing value to them every day. By reporting in this highly advanced way, you are reporting powerfully on the value you bring to the organization in a way that supports ongoing investment from the lasting impact of <span class="No-Break">your team.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-133"><a id="_idTextAnchor132"/>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>Measuring value for an organization is not easy. It takes thoughtful alignment with stakeholders about how to measure success, together. No one team can solve this independently; you must bring the discussion about value measurement into the early stages of the project, focus the stakeholders on the importance of alignment, and build a rigorous, transparent process into the normal flow of business. In my experience, many teams discuss having this capability, or may even claim to have something similar. In practice, very few teams do this consistently well across their entire company. Let’s normalize this process so that as a practice, we can demonstrate that there is an incredible <strong class="bold">return on investment</strong> (<strong class="bold">ROI</strong>) in data. In this chapter, we walked through the eight-step alignment methodology to drive outcomes with your stakeholders, common alignment challenges, and how to carry forward the measured outcomes to your stakeholder map for aggregated <span class="No-Break">value alignment.</span></p>
			<p>This chapter concludes <em class="italic">Part 1</em> of this book. In <em class="italic">Part 1</em>, we outlined how to bring a data program together, how to baseline your company, how to build a great team, and how to align with your stakeholders for powerful results. In <em class="italic">Part 2</em>, we will dig into the major data governance capabilities in detail, covering what they are, how to deploy them effectively, and how to measure the success of <span class="No-Break">each capability.</span></p>
