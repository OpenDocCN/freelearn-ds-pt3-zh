    required for any data governance program. The success or failure of a chief data
    & analytics officer hinges on being able to answer a few fundamental, core questions:
    Where is the company’s data? Who owns it? How is it classified? Is it safe & secure?
    Can I leverage it for value? Do I know how to reduce data risk? You will learn
    the answers to these questions and be guided through how to tactically set up
    a metadata management capability for success as we dive into the critical capability

- en: Simply put, metadata is information about data. Metadata capabilities are used
    to make data more understandable, accessible, and reusable. Metadata management
    is the process of creating, storing, organizing, maintaining, and using metadata.
    In my experience, metadata is one of the most underappreciated data capabilities,
    but it is foundational to any data management program. Metadata is the root of
    success when deployed and managed well and the root of failure when underfunded
    and underutilized.

- en: Metadata management is important for a number of reasons. First, it can help
    to improve the quality of data. By providing information about the data, metadata
    can help to ensure that it is accurate, complete, and consistent. Second, metadata
    can help to make data more accessible. By providing ways to search and filter
    metadata, users can more easily find the data they need. Third, metadata can help
    to make data more reusable.

    In my experience, data professionals sometimes skip basic definitions in an attempt
    not to insult the audience when launching data capabilities. However, starting
    with grounding definitions can be done with grace in a way that does not insult
    the business leader and still grounds the audience on what we will accomplish.

    simple yet impactful grounding slide can be set up with a basic premise and with
    the following verbal statement: “Before we dig into the details, I want to spend
    just a moment ensuring we all have the same common understanding of what it is
    we are going to discuss today. I, for one, have not been a metadata expert all
    my life, and thus, let’s take a moment to define what it is we mean when we talk
    about metadata today.” This simple yet non-offensive grounding centers the team
    on the definition together without sounding like we are preaching to our stakeholders.'

    the data for the company’s use. This model of stewardship enables the company
    to be able to identify any responsible parties and drive further accountability
    for the management of the data. When stewards exist and have clear roles and responsibilities
    (as we outlined in the data governance policy), then the company gets to reap
    the rewards from the additional care over the data.'

    cover both business models but specific enough not to include prospects or leads.
    Aligning the entire business included a wide range of stakeholders, some of whom
    were very passionate about the term. However hard the alignment was, it was critical
    we defined it properly so that our enterprise reporting and decision-making were

    these assumptions and validate the assumptions with the business users. For example,
    we believe that once we have a business glossary defined with adequate definitions
    and sourcing, we expect each report production time will be reduced by 20 hours
    due to upfront alignment vs. the back and forth experienced today. By using this
    assumption of 20 hours x 100 reports per year, we predict we will save 2,000 hours
    of labor per year (equivalent to one full-time employee). If your organization
    produces 1,000 reports per year (or 10,000), imagine the impact this simple solution
    can make.

    forums, and tools, as well as a roadmap to deliver. The work is never “done.”

    revenue term is inclusive of the common definition, when the division is specifying
    its product line, they may call it “product A revenue,” which clarifies that it
