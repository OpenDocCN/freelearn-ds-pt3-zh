    <h1 id="_idParaDest-4" class="Introduction-Title--PACKT-">Preface</h1>
    <p class="normal">When Tableau was first introduced, it was a dramatic paradigm shift away from clunky reports and endless data integration projects that often produced results long after relevant decisions could have been made. Tableau disrupted the paradigm for visually interacting with data. It made it easy and intuitive (and fun!) to be hands-on with the data, to receive instant visual feedback with every action, and to ask questions and uncover insights in a natural flow of thought and interaction. The result is an ever-growing <strong class="bold">#datafam</strong>, a community that loves Tableau for its simplicity, beauty, and its ability to make working with data fun!</p>
    <p class="normal">Tableau continues to expand and evolve in ways that make seeing and understanding data easier and more powerful. New features such as the Tableau Data Model, set and parameter actions, ever-growing geospatial support, animations, and new dashboard objects expand what's possible and make it easier than ever to gain and share insights from data.</p>
    <p class="normal">The continued evolution of Tableau Prep brings the same intuitive instant feedback to data prep and cleansing that Tableau Desktop brought to data visualization, greatly extending the analytical platform of Tableau. We'll cover these new features (and more) in the chapters of this book!</p>
    <p class="normal">We'll look at Tableau through the lens of understanding the underlying paradigm of how and why Tableau works, in the context of practical examples. Then, we'll build on this solid foundation of understanding so that you will have the tools and skills to tackle even the toughest data challenges!</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-5" class="title">Who this book is for</h1>
    <p class="normal">This book is for anyone who needs to see and understand their data! From the business user to the hardcore data analyst to the CEO, everyone needs to have the ability to ask and answer questions of data. Having a bit of background with data will definitely help, but you don't need to be confident with scripting, SQL, or database structures.</p>
    <p class="normal">Whether you're new to Tableau, or have been using it for months or even years, with this book you'll gain a solid foundation of understanding Tableau, and the tools and skills required to build toward an advanced mastery of the tool.</p>

    <h1 id="_idParaDest-7" class="title">To get the most out of this book</h1>
    <p class="normal">This book does not assume specific database knowledge, but it will definitely help to have some basic familiarity with data itself. We'll cover the foundational principles first, and while it may be tempting to skip the first chapter, please don't! We'll lay a foundation of terminology and explore the paradigm that will be used throughout the remainder of the book.</p>
    <p class="normal">You'll be able to follow along with many of the examples in the book using Tableau Desktop and Tableau Prep Builder (in <em class="italics">Chapter 15</em>, <em class="italics">Taming Data with Tableau Prep</em>).</p>
    <p class="normal">Most examples can be completed with almost any recent version of Tableau, but to fully explore the new Data Model capabilities, you will need Tableau 2020.2 or later.</p>
