			<h1 id="_idParaDest-307"><a id="_idTextAnchor306"/>Adoption That Drives Business Success</h1>
			<p>Now that we have covered what data governance is, how to gather support, design a program, baseline the organization, and launch and deliver against the plan, we need to be able to ensure solutions are used by the business. Driving the adoption of data solutions is not a one-time activity, nor does it end after the delivery of the program. While there should be initial adoption done during implementation, adoption is an ongoing activity that you and your team must master in order to ensure maximum impact is realized from <span class="No-Break">data investments.</span></p>
			<p>In short, your long-term success is tightly coupled with your ability to deliver value into perpetuity. Your data solutions will live or die based on the post-go-live, but most teams stop short of success by considering “go-live” the end milestone. This chapter will delve into the crucial, and often overlooked, aspect of data governance: adoption. We will explore why driving widespread use of data solutions is absolutely critical for maximizing <a id="_idIndexMarker886"/>impact and achieving your desired <strong class="bold">return on </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">investment</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">ROI</strong></span><span class="No-Break">).</span></p>
			<p>Data is the lifeblood of your organization. Businesses of all sizes and shapes are collecting and storing momentous amounts of data, recognizing its potential, but unfortunately, simply collecting and storing data is not enough. The true power of this data comes when it is unlocked through effective solutions. As we covered these in the first 14 chapters of this book, you know the key building blocks of data governance. You know why these capabilities matter, and you know how to discuss their value with stakeholders. Now, we need to focus on further adoption to drive business <span class="No-Break">success long-term.</span></p>
			<p>If adoption were easy, we would not need to dedicate an entire chapter to reinforcing the importance and discussing examples to drive adoption in your organization well. I will walk through challenges and opportunities associated with driving the adoption of data capabilities, as well as key factors that influence users’ willingness to use and adopt data solutions. We’ll also dig into strategies that can help you foster a culture of data adoption in <span class="No-Break">your organization.</span></p>
			<p>Before we begin, I am assuming you have a firm grasp of the concepts outlined in the previous 14 chapters. This chapter is solely focused on the adoption of the capabilities previously explained, and the assumption is that these capabilities are either “in development” or “live” in your environment, for the purposes of exploring adoption. In the context of this chapter, I will be working from this assumption unless <span class="No-Break">otherwise noted.</span></p>
			<p>Before we wrap up this chapter, you will have a firm framing of the importance of ongoing adoption to empower you and your teams to drive endless adoption of core, critical data solutions in your organization that have staying power, long after you move on to the next project or program (or even role!). Together, we will define what success looks like for your organization and how to ensure you nail the basics <span class="No-Break">of adoption.</span></p>
			<p>We will cover the following <span class="No-Break">main topics:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Why adoption matters – <span class="No-Break">getting started</span></li>
				<li>Low adoption <span class="No-Break">is costly</span></li>
				<li>Why does <span class="No-Break">adoption fail?</span></li>
				<li>How to succeed at driving <span class="No-Break">exceptional adoption</span></li>
				<li>Recovering from <span class="No-Break">failed launches</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Post-deployment</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-308"><a id="_idTextAnchor307"/>Why adoption matters – getting started</h1>
			<p>Driving the adoption <a id="_idIndexMarker887"/>of data governance solutions within a company requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses both the technical and human aspects of change, including employee responses to change, attitudes, and the overall organizational culture. There are some key, basics to start with as you frame out your <span class="No-Break">adoption approach.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-309"><a id="_idTextAnchor308"/>Start with the why</h2>
			<p>To bring people along on the journey to drive change, it’s best to start by explaining why change is <a id="_idIndexMarker888"/>required. What is or is not working well today that can benefit from the change? You should start by addressing three key areas when building <span class="No-Break">your messaging:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Align data solutions with business goals</strong>: Clearly communicate how the solution will solve specific pain points, improve efficiency, or generate new opportunities. Use real-world examples and quantifiable metrics to demonstrate the <span class="No-Break">value proposition.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Listen to feedback</strong>: Hear your stakeholders’ feedback about concerns they have. Be thoughtful about how you address the feedback, and adjust messaging to support their <span class="No-Break">concerns transparently.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Focus on user needs</strong>: Understand the challenges and priorities of different user groups and tailor the solution and training accordingly. Address concerns about job security and emphasize the benefits of data skills for career development. For example, a policy will enable compliance and will likely be well received out of principle, but an engineer may need more convincing and will need to better understand how policy requirements will help them to do their job <span class="No-Break">more effectively.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-310"><a id="_idTextAnchor309"/>Adjust the solution (if needed) and make it easy to use</h2>
			<p>As you meet with stakeholders, to help drive adoption, if they are providing feedback regarding <a id="_idIndexMarker889"/>the solution, specifically, with ways that will make it more useful for them, listen. Feedback is a gift and can be used to adjust and improve your solution to drive adoption rates up. These are a few things to specifically <span class="No-Break">listen for:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Invest in user-friendly tools and interfaces</strong>: Ensure the technology is intuitive and accessible, even for those with limited <span class="No-Break">technical expertise</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Provide robust training and support</strong>: Offer comprehensive training programs, user guides, and readily available support channels to help users overcome obstacles and learn to leverage the <span class="No-Break">solution effectively</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Promote self-service options</strong>: Design data dashboards and reports that empower users to access and analyze information without relying solely on <span class="No-Break">data analysts</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-311"><a id="_idTextAnchor310"/>Don’t forget about culture</h2>
			<p>As you are adjusting the solution as needed and making it easier to use, do not forget to think about <a id="_idIndexMarker890"/>the culture. Is your company spreadsheet first? Are people operating inside solutions, or are dashboards commonly used? Really thinking about where people work, how they work, and the openness of the culture at your company to change is critical in driving adoption. If you are trying to change the culture of people using spreadsheets to be more dashboard-driven, for example, you may need to start with a single group or leader to drive the change you seek. A few great ways to influence broader cultural shifts include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Lead by example</strong>: Encourage senior management to use and champion data-driven decision-making, setting the tone for <span class="No-Break">the organization</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Communicate success stories</strong>: Share real-world examples of how data-driven insights have led to positive outcomes within <span class="No-Break">the company</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Recognize and reward data-driven behaviors</strong>: Acknowledge and celebrate employees who actively use data solutions and leverage insights to improve <span class="No-Break">their work</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Organize data-driven events and workshops</strong>: Promote data literacy and encourage collaboration across departments through workshops, hackathons, and data <span class="No-Break">visualization contests</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-312"><a id="_idTextAnchor311"/>Address barriers to adoption</h2>
			<p>As you <a id="_idIndexMarker891"/>work through the preceding feedback and hear from your stakeholders, use their feedback to continuously improve your solution and drive further adoption. Make sure you consider the <span class="No-Break">following barriers:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Identify and address concerns</strong>: Actively listen to user feedback and address concerns about data privacy, security, job displacement, and potential <span class="No-Break">ethical implications.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Ensure data quality and governance</strong>: Implement data governance practices to ensure data accuracy, reliability, and <span class="No-Break">ethical use.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Prioritize data security</strong>: Implement robust security measures to protect sensitive data and build trust <span class="No-Break">among users.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Measure and iterate</strong>: Track adoption rates, user feedback, and the impact of data solutions. Use this data to continuously improve the user experience and adjust your approach for <span class="No-Break">maximum impact.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Remember – change takes time. Be patient and persistent in your efforts. Building a data-driven <a id="_idIndexMarker892"/>culture requires sustained commitment and continuous improvement. Collaboration is key, and you will need to involve stakeholders from across the organization in the planning, implementation, and adoption of data solutions. It’s important to take time to celebrate progress. Recognize and celebrate milestones to maintain momentum and keep users engaged. If you identify an early adopter of your solution, be bold in showcasing their success to the company. By implementing these strategies, you can create an environment where data solutions are embraced by employees across the company, unlocking the true potential of data-driven decision-making for <span class="No-Break">your organization.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-313"><a id="_idTextAnchor312"/>Low adoption is costly</h1>
			<p>Imagine this: your company spent millions of dollars deploying a wonderfully crafted, embedded data <a id="_idIndexMarker893"/>governance-by-design program, only to move on to the next project, and the benefits realized at <span class="No-Break">go-live evaporate.</span></p>
			<p><em class="italic">This happens. Every. </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Single. Day.</em></span></p>
			<p>Everyone has good intentions. We build a great business case. We deliver the program. We drive adoption with initial teams, groups, or systems. But over time, that adoption atrophies. Let’s dig into a specific example that is easy <span class="No-Break">to understand.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Amazing visualization</p>
			<p class="callout">Imagine a scenario where your company, eager to realize the full power of your data, invests in best-in-class data visualization technology. After months of vendor selection, procurement, development, and deployment, the solution sits unused, with minimal visualizations being built, in favor of using our old <span class="No-Break">favorite: spreadsheets.</span></p>
			<p>In this scenario, the data team that advocated for and gained approval to implement the solution loses credibility with the executive team because the visualization tool was only adopted by the data team, versus enterprise-wide as proposed. The ROI is not fully realized because <a id="_idIndexMarker894"/>the ROI was calculated at an enterprise, not divisional, scale. Your credibility is shot, and you are labeled as a “buys shiny objects” executive, and future investments are heavily scrutinized. Unfortunately, this paints an all-too-familiar picture for many organizations grappling with the critical challenge of data <span class="No-Break">solution adoption.</span></p>
			<p><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Now what?</em></span></p>
			<p>In short, you have work to do. You can’t go back in time and make a different plan, but you <em class="italic">can</em> make a change for how you drive adoption in future initiatives (and also repair failed adoption of past deployments, which we will cover in just a few pages in the <em class="italic">Why does adoption </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">fail?</em></span><span class="No-Break"> section).</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-314"><a id="_idTextAnchor313"/>Quantitative costs of low adoption</h2>
			<p>Low adoption costs come in many forms, both quantitative and qualitative. It’s important <a id="_idIndexMarker895"/>to understand both types so that you can appropriately <a id="_idIndexMarker896"/>ensure that you and your team do not undersell the importance of driving comprehensive and sustainable adoption of your data solutions. Let’s start with quantitative costs of low adoption, focusing on <span class="No-Break">tangible costs:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Financial</strong>: The initial investment in acquiring, implementing, and maintaining the data solution goes to waste. This includes software licenses, hardware costs, and team members dedicated to the development and maintenance of <span class="No-Break">your solution.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Duplication of effort</strong>: Teams continue to rely on outdated methods or manual data analysis, wasting time and resources. Now, your teams are paying for the “old” method <em class="italic">and</em> the “new” method, thus incurring a higher cost <span class="No-Break">of ownership.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Inefficient operations</strong>: Without widespread adoption, valuable data remains siloed and <a id="_idIndexMarker897"/>inaccessible, hindering collaboration and hindering <a id="_idIndexMarker898"/>the organization from leveraging the solution’s potential for <span class="No-Break">streamlining processes.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="callout-heading">Quantifying inefficiencies in time and opportunity</p>
			<p class="callout">These inefficiencies can be quantified by extrapolating the cost of the time required to access and drive solutions and the lost opportunity. This is a bit harder to quantify than others and will require some assumptions, but can <span class="No-Break">be quantified.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-315"><a id="_idTextAnchor314"/>Qualitative costs of low adoption</h2>
			<p>Low adoption costs do not stop at easy-to-quantify measures but are also inclusive of the qualitative <a id="_idIndexMarker899"/>impact of low adoption. These types of issues tend to be more about the employee or customer experience, the general culture of the organization, and the sentiment of all stakeholders. These costs are harder to move and thus have real staying power within an organization. It would be a mistake not to make sure these costs are clearly articulated and built into your <span class="No-Break">business plan.</span></p>
			<p>It is <em class="italic">valid</em> to articulate the risk to future programs as a risk to the success of the program you are working on. Especially when driving data capabilities in an organization that has not seen success in data previously, each failed adoption will drive a significant blow to the future success of other capabilities. This is often missed or <span class="No-Break">significantly underrepresented.</span></p>
			<p>Some key qualitative costs of low adoption include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Frustration and resistance</strong>: Low adoption can breed negative experiences and resistance among users who feel the solution is imposed, irrelevant, <span class="No-Break">or cumbersome.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Hinders future adoption efforts</strong>: Negative experiences can discourage other users from embracing new data solutions, creating a domino effect <span class="No-Break">of resistance.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Erodes trust in data</strong>: Users who perceive the solution as unreliable or unhelpful may lose trust in the value of data-driven decision-making altogether. This is the largest and most difficult risk to your success. Once trust is lost, it is very difficult <span class="No-Break">to repair.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Drains morale and productivity</strong>: Frustration with a poorly implemented solution can negatively impact employee morale <span class="No-Break">and productivity.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Delayed decision-making</strong>: Lack of access to real-time insights can lead to slow and potentially <span class="No-Break">inaccurate decisions.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Missed opportunities</strong>: Organizations may miss out on opportunities to optimize processes, identify trends, and unlock hidden potential within <span class="No-Break">their data.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Costs associated <a id="_idIndexMarker900"/>with the failed adoption of data governance solutions are significant. This information is great to put alongside the “why” section of your business case early on in your journey. You should include a rationale for why you should deploy the data governance capability, but that should be inclusive of why you also need to drive adoption post-development of <span class="No-Break">the capability.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Comparing data governance policy approaches and outcomes</p>
			<p class="callout">I have worked in two separate companies that had really low-quality data governance policies. In both organizations, we rewrote the policy as one of the early-stage focus areas <a id="_idIndexMarker901"/>because, in both cases, we were getting questions about what stewards should be doing to manage their data well. In one company, we were very short on resourcing, and thus, all we could do was re-publish the updated policy and answer the occasional question. In the other organization, we published the updated policy and drove an implementation plan that included walking the stewards through the adoption of the policy and had a much more “in the trenches with you” approach versus standing on <span class="No-Break">the sidelines.</span></p>
			<p class="callout">As you can probably predict, the company where we rolled out the policy <em class="italic">AND</em> that supported the adoption of the policy had a much higher data management maturity score (by about a whole point or so), and a more effective data management culture. Additionally, our data had fewer issues and higher trust in additional solutions we deployed <span class="No-Break">over time.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-316"><a id="_idTextAnchor315"/>Why does adoption fail?</h1>
			<p>There are a number of reasons that lead to the failure of data governance solutions. I have <a id="_idIndexMarker902"/>had success bucketing them into a few key themes, to help you identify where solutions go wrong and how you can prevent these failures from happening in your own adoption journey. They are broken into three <span class="No-Break">core categories:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">The solution</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">The company</span></li>
				<li>The <span class="No-Break">leader (you)</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>All three reasons are common, and all three reasons are very possible for any data governance <span class="No-Break">solution failure.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-317"><a id="_idTextAnchor316"/>The solution is the problem</h2>
			<p>The first and most commonly blamed barrier to success is the solution itself. This means that the <a id="_idIndexMarker903"/>solution built or created for your stakeholders is just not the right solution. Either it was the wrong solution altogether or the process and/or technology isn’t working as intended. In short, the solution isn’t going to work for your company’s needs. Usually, the solution issues are one or more of <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Usability and ease of use</strong>: An intuitive interface, clear functionality, and a minimal learning curve are essential for encouraging user engagement. A complex or poorly designed solution can create frustration and <span class="No-Break">hinder adoption.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Relevance and value proposition</strong>: The solution must address users’ specific needs and demonstrate clear value in improving their work or providing valuable insights. If users do not see the relevance of the solution to their daily tasks, they are less likely to <span class="No-Break">adopt it.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data quality and reliability</strong>: Users need to trust the accuracy and reliability of the data within the solution to make informed decisions based on its outputs. Inconsistent or unreliable data can undermine user confidence and <span class="No-Break">hinder adoption.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Integration with existing workflows</strong>: The solution should seamlessly integrate with existing workflows and tools to minimize disruption and maximize user acceptance. A cumbersome or disruptive solution can create additional work and <span class="No-Break">discourage adoption.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>These issues <a id="_idIndexMarker904"/>come up when either the team driving the work doesn’t fully understand the need or is unwilling to accept feedback as the solution is developed and/or deployed. You can counteract this risk by seeking to understand needs and feedback from and for your stakeholders and maintaining a willingness to adjust course when it looks like you aren’t going to meet <span class="No-Break">their needs.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-318"><a id="_idTextAnchor317"/>Your company is the problem</h2>
			<p>Unfortunately, your company can also be a barrier to success. When the company isn’t ready for <a id="_idIndexMarker905"/>data governance or is unwilling to consider new paths to new successes, the company can be the root cause of your failed adoption. It usually comes down to a few <span class="No-Break">core reasons:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Lack of leadership buy-in</strong>: Strong support and commitment from leadership are essential to create a culture that values data and encourages its utilization. Without leadership buy-in, data initiatives can lack the necessary direction and resources to succeed, fostering a skeptical attitude <span class="No-Break">toward adoption.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Ineffective change management</strong>: Effective communication, training, and support throughout the transition period are crucial to address user concerns and facilitate a smooth adoption process. A lack of clear communication and support can lead to confusion, resistance, and ultimately, <span class="No-Break">low adoption.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Poor organizational culture</strong>: A data-driven culture fosters openness to new information, encourages using data for informed decision-making, and values data literacy across the organization. A culture resistant to change or skeptical of data can significantly hinder <span class="No-Break">adoption efforts.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is the hardest of the barriers to overcome because while you can influence change, you are just one person. A company has to be open to change, willing to move away from old patterns, and effective at adopting new solutions (not just for data, but across many disciplines). This is why company-level change is such a hard barrier <span class="No-Break">to overcome.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-319"><a id="_idTextAnchor318"/>You are the problem</h2>
			<p>Hard to admit, but can be true. I have lived this experience, and yes, it is hard to admit and harder <a id="_idIndexMarker906"/>yet to acknowledge publicly and address. However, sometimes the problem is the leader sponsoring or deploying the solution. There can be many reasons why you are the barrier, but here are a few words <span class="No-Break">of encouragement:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>You can move aside and allow your team <span class="No-Break">to flourish</span></li>
				<li>You can ask for feedback, adapt, <span class="No-Break">and improve</span></li>
				<li>You can adjust your approach and try <span class="No-Break">new pathways</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you find yourself in a situation where you can’t seem to break through to a stakeholder or a group, you might try reviewing the preceding bullets, meeting with your stakeholder 1:1, asking for the coaching of a mentor or sponsor, and reconsidering your approach. This is not as difficult to overcome as the company barrier, but it requires a humble heart posture and a willingness to change approaches when you are running <span class="No-Break">into headwinds.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-320"><a id="_idTextAnchor319"/>How to succeed at driving exceptional adoption</h1>
			<p>The number <a id="_idIndexMarker907"/>one piece of advice I can give you to help you drive exceptional adoption in your organization and maximize your value in data governance solutions is <span class="No-Break">very simple:</span></p>
			<p><em class="italic">Focus ruthlessly </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">on adoption.</em></span></p>
			<p>That’s it! That’s the advice. Those who focus intently on driving value from adoption, measure adoption metrics, and focus on squeezing the most from the investments they have already made will get the best ROI on <span class="No-Break">their solutions.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Primary data management metrics</p>
			<p class="callout">In my first PDM deployment, we set very specific measurements to, you guessed it, measure <a id="_idIndexMarker908"/>the value of our solution. Seems straightforward, but we really pushed ourselves to think beyond simply go-live and focused our measurement on adoption as well. We did publish specific metrics about standing up the capability (for example, # of attributes published), but we pushed ourselves to also track, for each attribute, # of systems adopted. This forced us to look beyond simply making the data available but also downstream to which platforms were consuming our newly published <span class="No-Break">primary data.</span></p>
			<p class="callout">If I were to run that program again, I would push us to go a step further and also track the # of key reports published using the primary data. Would it be tough to verify this? Yes. Would it show the full downstream impact of maximizing value in our investment? <span class="No-Break">Also, yes.</span></p>
			<p>As you work <a id="_idIndexMarker909"/>to drive exceptional adoption in your organization, there are a few focus areas to help you <span class="No-Break">be successful:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Demonstrate value early</strong>: Showcase real-impact use cases and quantifiable benefits achieved through the data governance solution, emphasizing how it can address users’ pain points and improve their work. This can involve creating pilot deliverables in specific departments, sharing success stories, and quantifying the impact of the solution on <span class="No-Break">key metrics.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Transparency and clear communication</strong>: Keep users informed about the solution’s purpose, benefits, and implementation timeline throughout the process. Address concerns and answer questions transparently. This fosters trust and reduces anxiety <span class="No-Break">about changes.</span><ul><li><strong class="bold">Bonus: create targeted communication</strong>: Tailor communication channels and messaging to different user personas based on their needs, technical expertise, and preferred communication methods. This ensures they receive relevant information in a way that resonates <span class="No-Break">with them.</span></li></ul></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Build feedback loops</strong>: Encourage user feedback through surveys, focus groups, and open communication channels. Consider their suggestions for improvement and address their concerns. This demonstrates the organization’s responsiveness to user needs and fosters a sense <span class="No-Break">of ownership.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Invest in user experience</strong>: Prioritize user-friendly design, intuitive interfaces, and robust training programs to minimize the learning curve and ensure users can leverage the solution’s functionalities effectively. This includes features such as intuitive navigation, clear visualizations, and readily <span class="No-Break">accessible documentation.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Training and ongoing support</strong>: Provide comprehensive training programs that cater to different learning styles and are readily accessible. Offer ongoing support through dedicated help desks, online resources, and knowledge-sharing platforms. This <a id="_idIndexMarker910"/>empowers users and addresses their questions as they navigate the data <span class="No-Break">governance solution.</span><ul><li><strong class="bold">Hint</strong>: Do not stop at the go-live. Offer ongoing user training beyond go-live so that users who onboard later have the same delightful onboarding experience as anyone who was there at launch. Consider offering a monthly or quarterly session to bring new users up to speed and answer questions. Content is reusable, but the value of meeting the user where they are is worth <span class="No-Break">the repetition.</span></li></ul></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Foster a data-driven culture</strong>: Encourage leadership to lead by example by showcasing data-driven decision-making in meetings and presentations. Promote open communication around data utilization and celebrate successes achieved through data-driven insights. This creates a visible commitment to data and helps users understand <span class="No-Break">its value.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In summary, the key to success is to think all the way to the ultimate individual who is impacted by the work you are doing. We often think about the person we provide the solution directly to, but when it comes to data solutions, so many of the capabilities we drive have a ripple effect. They impact the person we are working with directly – yes, but the capabilities impact so <span class="No-Break">many more.</span></p>
			<p>Consider the previous data governance policy example I shared for a moment. While the policy is directed (primarily) at stewards and users of data, they aren’t the full story. Ultimately, you must think about who else is impacted by the policy: the customers, the employees, the users of systems, the readers of reports, the executives making decisions, the Board of Directors, and stakeholders across the enterprise as a whole (to name a few). I try to put myself in the customers’ shoes. What will my experience be, as a customer, when this new data governance capability is fully realized and I can <span class="No-Break">feel it?</span></p>
			<p>The answer <a id="_idIndexMarker911"/>to that question is what good adoption should be based on. Not the deployment itself, but the felt and lived experience of the ultimate individual person who is impacted by the success of your team. That person, whom you may never speak to and may never know. Impacting their experience is what it is all about. The more you can put yourself in the embodiment of their journey, the more successful you will be at driving great adoption in <span class="No-Break">your organization.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-321"><a id="_idTextAnchor320"/>Recovering from failed launches</h1>
			<p>We all have these moments. You’ve built an amazing solution. You are so proud. The team is <a id="_idIndexMarker912"/>excited, it works great, and you can’t wait for the users to get their hands on it and <span class="No-Break">use it.</span></p>
			<p>And then, it’s quiet. No one is excited. The user metrics are – well, they’re low. You are left scratching your head. You might be pondering <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>What <span class="No-Break">went wrong?</span></li>
				<li>Why is there <span class="No-Break">no buzz?</span></li>
				<li>Doesn’t <span class="No-Break">anyone care?</span></li>
				<li>Where did all the <span class="No-Break">excitement go?</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Unfortunately, what you are experiencing is a failed launch. It happens to everyone. You think it’s going well, and then…nothing. You have no more support, and all your expected users have either moved on to the next thing or are reverting back to their <span class="No-Break">old solution.</span></p>
			<p>The question is, what can you do <span class="No-Break">about it?</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-322"><a id="_idTextAnchor321"/>Uncover the root problem</h2>
			<p>First, you need to identify why your program failed. The preceding questions can help you start <a id="_idIndexMarker913"/>to identify what went wrong. It usually comes back to one or more of the following <span class="No-Break">probable causes:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Misdiagnosed problem</strong>: Without fully exploring the problem, you could have not fully addressed the problem statement, and thus did not address the issue the stakeholders truly need to <span class="No-Break">be addressed</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Misinformed decisions</strong>: Continued reliance on intuition or outdated data can lead to inaccurate assessments, hindering <span class="No-Break">strategic planning</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Poor resource allocation</strong>: Resources may be allocated to the wrong areas based on faulty assumptions or <span class="No-Break">inaccurate data</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Only partial solution</strong>: You may have deployed a great solution, but if it doesn’t address all of the problems the stakeholder is facing, you might not get their buy-in to adopt the part of the problem you <span class="No-Break">did address</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>When you experience this moment of reckoning, having to reevaluate why your solution did not get the adoption you expected, you haven’t failed. This is a bump in the process, but all hope is not lost. What you can do is start by asking for partnership with your stakeholders. Start by asking for their support and collaboration to <span class="No-Break">drive forward.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-323"><a id="_idTextAnchor322"/>Collaboration (almost always) wins</h2>
			<p>Effective communication and collaboration are crucial elements throughout the data solution <a id="_idIndexMarker914"/>adoption journey, but especially critical when you have a failed launch. Ask your stakeholders to evaluate the following capabilities, and sharpen your approach going forward to improve and <span class="No-Break">establish them:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Establish clear communication channels</strong>: Create dedicated communication channels, such as email newsletters, internal wikis, or designated forums, to keep users informed about the solution, its progress, and any updates. Ask if previous channels worked or if there needs to be adjustments to incorporate feedback loops (see the <em class="italic">How to succeed at driving</em> <em class="italic">exceptional </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">adoption</em></span><span class="No-Break"> section).</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Empower data champions</strong>: Identify and empower “data champions” within different departments who are enthusiastic about the solution and can advocate for its benefits among their peers. These individuals can provide hands-on guidance and address common concerns within their teams. Consider spotlighting <a id="_idIndexMarker915"/>a stakeholder on a regular basis to share their personal story of how adopting the solution has changed their <span class="No-Break">employee experience.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Foster collaboration and knowledge sharing</strong>: Encourage collaboration and knowledge sharing across departments through events, workshops, or online communities dedicated to data and the implemented solution. This allows users to learn from each other’s experiences and <span class="No-Break">best practices.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-324"><a id="_idTextAnchor323"/>Post-deployment</h1>
			<p>Whether your deployment went well and adoption is progressing nicely, or you had to reapproach <a id="_idIndexMarker916"/>adoption as outlined in the section directly before this, you will need to focus on the adoption that occurs post-deployment. Early adopters aside, what happens after go-live is just the beginning of your success as a <span class="No-Break">data professional.</span></p>
			<p>First, assign someone on your team to build out a post-go-live adoption framework. This will include key capabilities such as <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>What is required for post-go-live adoption from us? From stakeholders? <span class="No-Break">From users?</span></li>
				<li>What is a reasonable <span class="No-Break">onboarding timeline?</span></li>
				<li>How will adoptions <span class="No-Break">be funded?</span></li>
				<li>How will we <span class="No-Break">measure success?</span></li>
				<li>How will we measure <span class="No-Break">ongoing ROI?</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>This framework should be flexible enough to be leveraged for any data governance solution that your team deploys but focused enough that your stakeholders know what to expect from you on an <span class="No-Break">ongoing basis.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-325"><a id="_idTextAnchor324"/>Adoption roadmap</h2>
			<p>One of the key areas of your post-go-live adoption framework should include the building <a id="_idIndexMarker917"/>of an adoption roadmap. Given that the adoption process is ongoing, you should be refreshing the roadmap on an ongoing basis. I recommend you build a value stream for each onboarding event (for example, system, report, user, as applicable for your solution), with the “go-live” for their adoption, plus any hypercare or ongoing support you will <span class="No-Break">provide post-go-live.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-326"><a id="_idTextAnchor325"/>Monitoring activities</h2>
			<p>After the adoption for each group, you should ensure you are tracking appropriate metrics <a id="_idIndexMarker918"/>to monitor the impact of your solution. This may be captured in a number of ways, but I would recommend considering at least the following <span class="No-Break">monitoring metrics:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Hours saved</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Dollars saved</span></li>
				<li>Data <span class="No-Break">quality improvement</span></li>
				<li>Employee/team member <span class="No-Break">experience improvement</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>You should capture this information for each go-live but also keep a running total of the aggregate for your solution. As with any value measurement, be sure to validate the methodology and/or calculation with the beneficiary of the solution, and separately validate the output of that methodology <span class="No-Break">and/or calculation.</span></p>
			<p>Lastly, don’t forget to report the value achieved by group and in aggregate as one of your program-level value metrics. This is a key portion of how you measure the success of your team’s impact on the company. It’s very difficult to go back and try to measure this later, so be sure to capture <span class="No-Break">it now.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-327"><a id="_idTextAnchor326"/>Baking adoption into SDLC practices</h2>
			<p>Once you have a stable solution that is widely adopted, the final best practice is to embed the <a id="_idIndexMarker919"/>solution into a standard <strong class="bold">System Development Life Cycle</strong> (<strong class="bold">SDLC</strong>) process to ensure it is a part of any future development. Depending <a id="_idIndexMarker920"/>on the type of solution, you may <a id="_idIndexMarker921"/>also want to include it in your standard project management office process (for example, data policy). Next are some key strategies you <span class="No-Break">can implement.</span></p>
			<h3>Start early and integrate throughout</h3>
			<p>As you work toward broadscale adoption of data governance, a great place to drive wide-scale <a id="_idIndexMarker922"/>implementation is through embedding data governance requirements into the SDLC process. This will enable your company to go live with new solutions with data governance <span class="No-Break">by design:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Involve data stakeholders in requirement gathering and planning</strong>: Include data analysts, scientists, and business users in discussions to understand their needs and ensure the solution aligns with the <span class="No-Break">data strategy</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Conduct data feasibility assessments</strong>: Evaluate the quality, accessibility, and relevance of existing data before <span class="No-Break">development begins</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Design for usability and interoperability</strong>: Prioritize user-friendly interfaces and integrate them with existing systems for seamless data flow <span class="No-Break">and adoption</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Imagine going live with data dictionaries, data stewards, and great end-to-end data lineage available from day 1. Starting early in the SDLC process enables you and your team to drive data governance through each release <span class="No-Break">into production.</span></p>
			<h3>Implement data governance and quality</h3>
			<p>As you <a id="_idIndexMarker923"/>implement data governance <a id="_idIndexMarker924"/>into the SDLC process, be sure to focus on the following key components for the most <span class="No-Break">significant impact:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Define data standards and guidelines</strong>: Establish clear rules for data formats, naming conventions, and access controls to ensure consistency <span class="No-Break">and reliability</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Integrate data validation and testing into SDLC stages</strong>: Automate data cleaning <a id="_idIndexMarker925"/>and verification processes <a id="_idIndexMarker926"/>at every step to maintain <span class="No-Break">data quality</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Promote data literacy and training</strong>: Equip developers and users with the skills to understand, manage, and interpret <span class="No-Break">data effectively</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Focus on collaboration and communication</h3>
			<p>Data governance is a team sport. Be sure to establish the collaborative forums necessary to <a id="_idIndexMarker927"/>ensure everyone exits the SDLC process with a win. Focus on ensuring you complete <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Establish clear communication channels</strong>: Regularly share progress updates, address concerns, and gather feedback from data stakeholders throughout the <span class="No-Break">development cycle</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Form cross-functional teams</strong>: Break down silos and encourage collaboration between developers, data teams, and business users to foster joint ownership <span class="No-Break">and understanding</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Document data requirements and usage</strong>: Create clear documentation for data sources, transformations, and usage within the solution, ensuring future maintainability <span class="No-Break">and adoption</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Continuously monitor and iterate</h3>
			<p>As you <a id="_idIndexMarker928"/>continuously work through the SDLC process, there are a few key ways you can monitor for continuous improvement and iterate your solutions for even <span class="No-Break">better adoption:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Track key adoption metrics</strong>: Measure usage rates, user satisfaction, and the impact of data solutions on <span class="No-Break">business objectives</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Gather user feedback through surveys and interviews</strong>: Identify pain points, suggest improvements, and ensure solutions meet <span class="No-Break">evolving needs</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Agilely iterate and adapt</strong>: Based on feedback and metrics, continuously refine <a id="_idIndexMarker929"/>the data solution and user experience to drive broader adoption and <span class="No-Break">value realization</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Leverage automation and tools</h3>
			<p>Finally, as you consider how to drive further adoption, consider ways to automate solutions, improve <a id="_idIndexMarker930"/>the way work is completed, and automate data pipelines where appropriate. If you can make it easier for your stakeholders to consume your solutions by automating when data assets are embedded in their flow of work, they will be more likely to consume them. Consider <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Automate data pipelines and integrations</strong>: Eliminate manual data tasks and reduce the burden on teams, fostering <span class="No-Break">smoother adoption</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Utilize data visualization tools</strong>: Create user-friendly dashboards and reports to make data accessible and actionable for <span class="No-Break">diverse audiences</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Explore self-service data access options</strong>: Empower users to explore and analyze data independently, increasing engagement and <span class="No-Break">data-driven decision-making</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>You should tailor your approach to your specific context. Consider factors such as organizational size, culture, technical expertise, and data maturity when implementing these strategies. You should seek ongoing buy-in from leadership <span class="No-Break">as well.</span></p>
			<p>You can and should emphasize the strategic value of data solutions and secure top-level support for sustained adoption efforts. Lastly, invest in change management. Provide training, resources, and clear communication to support individuals through the transition to a more data-driven culture. By baking adoption into your SDLC from the start and using these strategies throughout the process, you can increase the chances of successful data solution implementation and maximize their impact on <span class="No-Break">your organization.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-328"><a id="_idTextAnchor327"/>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>Adoption is a continuous journey. Until the solution is retired or decommissioned, you will be driving ongoing adoption of your solution. Data solutions are powerful tools, but their true power lies in their widespread adoption and utilization. By understanding the cost of low adoption, the factors influencing user behavior, and the various strategies for fostering engagement, organizations can create a culture of data-driven decision-making and unlock the full potential of their <span class="No-Break">data investments.</span></p>
			<p>Data adoption is not a one-time event; it’s a continuous journey requiring ongoing effort, engagement, and commitment to building a data-driven culture within your organization. By embracing the strategies outlined and fostering an environment that values data and user experience, organizations can navigate the path toward successful data adoption and turn data into a powerful engine <span class="No-Break">for success.</span></p>
