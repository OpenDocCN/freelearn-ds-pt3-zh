- en: When Tableau was first introduced, it was a dramatic paradigm shift away from
    clunky reports and endless data integration projects that often produced results
    long after relevant decisions could have been made. Tableau disrupted the paradigm
    for visually interacting with data. It made it easy and intuitive (and fun!) to
    be hands-on with the data, to receive instant visual feedback with every action,
    and to ask questions and uncover insights in a natural flow of thought and interaction.
    The result is an ever-growing **#datafam**, a community that loves Tableau for
    its simplicity, beauty, and its ability to make working with data fun!

    data easier and more powerful. New features such as the Tableau Data Model, set
    and parameter actions, ever-growing geospatial support, animations, and new dashboard
    objects expand what's possible and make it easier than ever to gain and share
    insights from data.

    to data prep and cleansing that Tableau Desktop brought to data visualization,
    greatly extending the analytical platform of Tableau. We'll cover these new features
    (and more) in the chapters of this book!
