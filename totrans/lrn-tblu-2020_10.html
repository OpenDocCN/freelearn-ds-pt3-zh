    <h1 id="_idParaDest-201" class="chapterTitle">Advanced Visualizations </h1>
    <p class="normal">We've explored many different types of visualizations and considered which types of questions they best answer. For example, bar charts aid in comparing values; line charts can show changes and trends over time; stacked bars and treemaps help us see part-to-whole relationships; box plots help us understand distributions and outliers. We've also seen how to enhance our understanding and data storytelling with calculations, annotations, formatting, and reference lines. With this knowledge as a foundation, we'll expand the possibilities of data analysis with some advanced visualizations.</p>
    <p class="normal">These are only examples of Tableau's amazing flexibility and are meant to inspire you to think through new ways of seeing, understanding, and communicating your data. These are not designed as complex charts for the sake of complexity, but rather to spark creativity and interest to effectively communicate data.</p>
    <p class="normal">We'll consider the following topics:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="list">Advanced visualizations – when and why to use them</li>
      <li class="list">Slope charts and bump charts</li>
      <li class="list">Waterfall charts</li>
      <li class="list">Step lines and jump lines</li>
      <li class="list">Spark lines</li>
      <li class="list">Dumbbell charts</li>
      <li class="list">Unit/symbol charts</li>
      <li class="list">Marimekko charts</li>
      <li class="list">Animated visualizations</li>
    </ul>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-202" class="title">Advanced visualizations – when and why to use them</h1>
    <p class="normal">The visualization<a id="_idIndexMarker951"/> types we've seen up to this point will answer many, if not most, of the questions you have about your data. If you are asking questions of <em class="italics">when?</em>, then a time series is the most likely solution. If you are asking <em class="italics">how much?</em>, a bar chart gives a good, quick result. But there are times when you'll ask questions that are better answered with a different type of visualization. For example, movement or flow might be best represented with a Sankey diagram. <em class="italics">How many?</em> might be best answered with a unit or symbol chart. Comparing changes in ranks or absolute values might be best accomplished with a slope or bump chart. The visualizations that follow are not what you will use as you first explore the data. But as you dive deeper into your analysis and want to know or communicate more, you might consider some of the options in this chapter.</p>
    <p class="normal">Each of the visualizations in this chapter is created using the supplied <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Superstore</code> data. Instead of providing step-by-step instructions, we'll point out specific advanced techniques used to create each chart type. The goal is not to memorize steps but to understand how to creatively leverage Tableau's features.</p>
    <p class="normal">You can find completed examples in the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Chapter 10 Complete</code> workbook, or test your growing Tableau skills by building everything from scratch using the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Chapter 10 Starter</code> workbook.</p>
    <p class="normal">Let's start our journey into advanced visualizations with slope and bump charts.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-203" class="title">Slope charts and bump charts</h1>
    <p class="normal">A <strong class="bold">slope chart</strong> shows a <a id="_idIndexMarker952"/>change of values from one period or status to another. For example, here is a slope chart demonstrating the change in sales rank for each state in the <strong class="screen-text">South</strong> region from <strong class="screen-text">2016</strong> to <strong class="screen-text">2017</strong>:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_10_01.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.1: A slope chart is useful to compare the change of rank or absolute values from one period or status to another</p>
    <p class="normal">Here are some features<a id="_idIndexMarker953"/> and techniques used to create the preceding slope chart:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="list">The table calculation <strong class="screen-text">Rank(SUM(Sales))</strong> is computed by (addressed by) <strong class="screen-text">State</strong>, meaning that each state is ranked within the partition of a single year.</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="screen-text">Grid Lines</strong> and <strong class="screen-text">Zero Lines</strong> for <strong class="screen-text">Rows</strong> have been set to <strong class="screen-text">None</strong>.</li>
      <li class="list">The axis has been reversed (right-click the axis and select <strong class="screen-text">Edit</strong>, then check the option to reverse). This allows rank <strong class="screen-text">#1</strong> to appear at the top and lower ranks to appear in descending order.</li>
      <li class="list">The axis has been hidden (right-click the axis and uncheck <strong class="screen-text">Show Header</strong>).</li>
      <li class="list">Labels have been edited (by clicking on <strong class="screen-text">Label</strong>) to show on both ends of the line, to center vertically, and to position the rank number next to the state name.</li>
      <li class="list">The year column headers have been moved from the bottom of the view to the top (from the top menu, select <strong class="screen-text">Analysis | Table Layout | Advanced</strong> and uncheck the option to show the innermost level at the bottom).</li>
      <li class="list">A <strong class="bold">data highlighter</strong> has<a id="_idIndexMarker954"/> been added (using the dropdown on the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">State</code> field in the view, select <strong class="screen-text">Show Highlighter</strong>) to give the end user the ability to highlight one or more states.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="note">
      <p class="Information-Box--PACKT-">Data highlighters give the user the ability to highlight marks in a view by selecting values from the drop-down list or by typing (any match on any part of a value will highlight the mark; so, for example, typing <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Carolina</code> would highlight <strong class="screen-text">North Carolina</strong> and <strong class="screen-text">South Carolina</strong> in the preceding view). Data highlighters can be shown for any field you use as discrete (blue) in the view and will function across multiple views in a dashboard as long as that same field is used in those views.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">Slope charts can use absolute values (for example, the actual values of <strong class="screen-text">Sales</strong>) or relative values (for example, the rank of <strong class="screen-text">Sales</strong>, as shown in this example). If you were to show more than two years to observe the change in rankings over multiple periods of time, the resulting visualization might be called a <strong class="bold">Bump Chart</strong> and <a id="_idIndexMarker955"/>look like this:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_10_02.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.2: This bump chart shows the change in rank for each state over time and makes use of a highlighter</p>
    <p class="normal">Slope charts are very useful when comparing ranks before and after or from one state to another. Bump charts extend this concept across more than two periods. Consider using either of these two charts when you want to understand the relative change in rank and make comparisons against that change.</p>
    <p class="normal">Next, we'll consider a chart that helps us understand the build-up of parts to the whole.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-204" class="title">Waterfall charts</h1>
    <p class="normal">A <strong class="bold">waterfall chart</strong> is useful when you want to show how parts successively build up to a whole. In the <a id="_idIndexMarker956"/>following screenshot, for example, a waterfall chart shows how profit builds up to a grand total across <strong class="screen-text">Departments</strong> and <strong class="screen-text">Categories</strong> of products. Sometimes profit is negative, so at that point, the waterfall chart takes a dip, while positive values build up toward the total:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_10_03.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.3: This waterfall chart shows how each Category adds (or subtracts) profit to build toward the total</p>
    <p class="normal">Here are the features and techniques used to build the chart:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="list">The <strong class="screen-text">SUM(Profit)</strong> field on <strong class="screen-text">Rows</strong> is a <strong class="bold">Running Total</strong> table calculation (created using a <strong class="bold">Quick Table Calculation</strong> from the drop-down menu) and is computed across the table.</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Row Grand Totals</strong> have been added to the view (dragged and dropped from the <strong class="screen-text">Analytics</strong> pane).</li>
      <li class="list">The mark type is set to <strong class="bold">Gantt Bar</strong> and an ad hoc calculation is used with code: <strong class="screen-text">SUM(Profit)</strong> for the size. This may seem a bit odd at first, but it causes the Gantt Bars to be drawn from the actual value and filled down when profit is positive or filled up when profit is negative.</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="screen-text">Category</strong> has been <a id="_idIndexMarker957"/>sorted by the sum of their profit in ascending order so that the waterfall chart builds slowly (or negatively) from left to right within each <strong class="screen-text">Department</strong>. You might want to experiment with the sort options to discover the impact on the presentation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Waterfall charts will help you demonstrate a build-up or progression toward a total or whole value. Let's next consider step lines and jump lines to show discrete changes over time.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-205" class="title">Step lines and jump lines</h1>
    <p class="normal">With a mark type of <strong class="screen-text">Line</strong>, click the <strong class="screen-text">Path</strong> shelf and you'll see three options for <strong class="screen-text">Line Type</strong>:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_10_04.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.4: Change the type of Line by clicking Path on the Marks card</p>
    <p class="normal">The three options are:</p>
    <ol>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Linear</strong>: Use <a id="_idIndexMarker958"/>angled lines to emphasize movement or transition between values. This is the default and every example of a line chart in this book so far has made use of this line type.</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Step lines</strong>: Remain<a id="_idIndexMarker959"/> connected but emphasize discrete steps of change. This is useful when you want to communicate that there is no transition between values or that the transition is a discrete step in value. For example, you might want to show the number of generators running over time. The change from 7 to 8 is a discrete change that might be best represented by a step line.</li>
    
      <li class="list" value="3"><strong class="bold">Jump lines</strong> are not <a id="_idIndexMarker960"/>connected; and when a value changes a new line starts. Jump lines are useful when you want to show values that indicate a certain state that may exist for a given period of time before jumping to another state. For example, you might wish to show the daily occupancy rate of a hotel over time. A jump line might help emphasize that each day is a new value.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="normal">In the following example, we've taken the build-up of profit that was previously demonstrated with a <strong class="bold">waterfall chart</strong> and used step lines to show each successive step of profit:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_10_05.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.5: A step line chart emphasizes an abrupt change or discrete difference</p>
    <p class="normal">Experiment with switching line types to see the visual impact and what each communicates about the data.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-206" class="title">Sparklines</h1>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Sparklines</strong> are visualizations<a id="_idIndexMarker961"/> that use multiple small line graphs that are designed to be read and compared quickly. The goal of sparklines is to give a visualization that can be understood at a glance. You aren't trying to communicate exact values, but rather give the audience the ability to quickly understand trends, movements, and patterns.</p>
    <p class="normal">Among various uses of this type of visualization, you may have seen sparklines used in financial publications to compare the movement of stock prices. Recall, that in <em class="italics">Chapter 1</em>, <em class="italics">Taking Off with Tableau</em>, we considered the initial start of a <strong class="bold">Sparklines</strong> visualization as we looked at iterations of line charts. Here is a far more developed example:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_10_06.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.6: Spark Lines give you a quick glance at the "shape" of change over time across multiple categories </p>
    <p class="normal">You can build a chart like<a id="_idIndexMarker962"/> this by following these steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li class="list" value="1">Start with a simple view of <strong class="screen-text">SUM(Sales)</strong> by <strong class="screen-text">Quarter</strong> of <strong class="screen-text">Order Date</strong> (as a date value) with <strong class="screen-text">Category</strong> on <strong class="screen-text">Rows</strong>.</li>
      <li class="list">Create two calculated fields to show the minimum and maximum quarterly sales values for each category. <strong class="screen-text">Min Sales</strong> has the code <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">WINDOW_MIN(SUM(Sales))</code> and <strong class="screen-text">Max Sales</strong> has the code <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">WINDOW_MAX(SUM(Sales))</code>. Add both to <strong class="screen-text">Rows</strong> as discrete (blue) fields.</li>
      <li class="list">Place the calculation <strong class="screen-text">Last Sales</strong> with the code <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">IF LAST() == 0 THEN SUM([Sales]) END</code> on <strong class="screen-text">Rows</strong> and uses a synchronized dual axis with a circle mark type to emphasize the final value of sales for each timeline.</li>
      <li class="list">Edit the axis for <strong class="screen-text">SUM(Sales)</strong> to have independent axis ranges for each row or column and hide the axes. This allows the line movement to be emphasized. Remember: the goal is not to show the exact values, but to allow your audience to see the patterns and movement.</li>
      <li class="list">Hide grid lines for <strong class="screen-text">Rows</strong>.</li>
    
      <li class="list" value="6">Resize the view<a id="_idIndexMarker963"/> (compress the view horizontally and set to <strong class="screen-text">Fit Height</strong>). This allows the sparklines to fit into a small space, facilitating the quick understanding of patterns and movement.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="normal">Sparklines can be used with all kinds of time series to reveal overall big-picture trends and behaviors at a glance.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-207" class="title">Dumbbell charts</h1>
    <p class="normal">A <strong class="bold">dumbbell chart</strong> is a variation <a id="_idIndexMarker964"/>of the circle plot that compares two values for each slice of data, emphasizing the distance between the two values.</p>
    <p class="normal">Here, for example, is a chart showing the <strong class="screen-text">Difference in Profit between East and West</strong> regions for each <strong class="screen-text">Category</strong> of products:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_10_07.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.7: A dumbbell chart emphasizes the distance/difference between two values</p>
    <p class="normal">This chart was built using the following features and techniques:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="list">A synchronized dual axis of <strong class="screen-text">SUM(Profit)</strong> has been used with one set to mark the type of <strong class="screen-text">Circle</strong> and the other set to <strong class="screen-text">Line</strong>.</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="screen-text">Category</strong> has been sorted by <strong class="screen-text">Profit</strong> descending (the sort sums profit for East and West).</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="screen-text">Region</strong> has been placed on the <strong class="screen-text">Path</strong> shelf for the line to tell Tableau to draw a line between the two <strong class="bold">Regions</strong>.
    <div class="note">
      <p class="Information-Box--PACKT-">The <strong class="screen-text">Path</strong> shelf is available for <strong class="bold">Line</strong> and <strong class="bold">Polygon</strong> mark types. When you place a field on the <strong class="screen-text">Path</strong> shelf, it tells Tableau the order to connect the points (following the sort order of the field placed on <strong class="screen-text">Path</strong>). Paths are often used with geographic visualizations to connect origins and destinations on routes but can be used with other visualization types. Tableau draws a single line between two values (in this case East and West).</p>
    </div>
	</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li class="list"><strong class="screen-text">Region</strong> is placed on <strong class="screen-text">Color</strong> for the circle mark type.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Dumbbell charts are great at<a id="_idIndexMarker965"/> highlighting the disparity between values. Let's next consider how we can use unit/symbol charts to drive responses.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-208" class="title">Unit/symbol charts</h1>
    <p class="normal">A <strong class="bold">unit chart</strong> can be <a id="_idIndexMarker966"/>used to show individual items, often using shapes or symbols to represent each individual. These charts can elicit a powerful emotional response because the representations of the data are less abstract and more easily identified as something real. For example, here is a chart showing how many customers had late shipments for each <strong class="screen-text">Region</strong>:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_10_08.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.8: Each image represents a real person and is less abstract than circles or squares</p>
    <p class="normal">The view was created<a id="_idIndexMarker967"/> with the following techniques:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="list">The view is filtered where <strong class="screen-text">Late Shipping</strong> is <strong class="screen-text">True</strong>. <strong class="screen-text">Late Shipping</strong> is a calculated field that determines if it took more than <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">14</code> days to ship an order. The code is as follows:
        <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">DATEDIFF('day', [<span class="hljs-keyword">Order</span> <span class="hljs-title">Date</span>], [<span class="hljs-keyword">Ship</span> <span class="hljs-title">Date</span>]) &gt; <span class="hljs-number">14</span> 
</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="screen-text">Region</strong> has been sorted by the distinct count of <strong class="screen-text">Customer ID </strong>in descending order.</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="screen-text">Customer ID</strong> has been placed on <strong class="screen-text">Detail</strong> so that there is a mark for each distinct customer.</li>
      <li class="list">The mark type has been changed to <strong class="screen-text">Shape</strong> and the shape has been changed to the included person shape in the <strong class="screen-text">Gender</strong> shape palette. To change shapes, click the <strong class="screen-text">Shape</strong> shelf and select the desired shape(s), as shown in the following screenshot:
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_10_09.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.9: You can assign shapes to dimensional values using the Shape shelf</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">The preceding<a id="_idIndexMarker968"/> unit chart might elicit more of a response from regional managers than a standard bar chart when they are gently reminded that poor customer service impacts real people. Granted, the shapes are still abstract, but more closely represent an actual person. You could also consider labeling the mark with the customer name or using other techniques to further engage your audience.</p>
    <div class="packt_tip">
      <p>Remember that normally in Tableau, a mark is drawn for each distinct intersection of dimensional values. So, it is rather difficult to draw, for example, <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">10</code> individual shapes for a single row of data that simply contains the value <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">10</code> for a field. This means that you will need to consider the shape of your data and include enough rows to draw the units you wish to represent.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">Concrete shapes, in any type of <a id="_idIndexMarker969"/>visualization, can also dramatically reduce the amount of time it takes to comprehend the data. Contrast the amount of effort required to identify the departments in these two scatterplots:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_10_10.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.10: Notice the difference in "cognitive load" between the left chart and the right</p>
    <p class="normal">Once you know the meaning of a shape, you no longer have to reference a legend. Placing a discrete field on the <strong class="screen-text">Shape</strong> shelf allows you to assign shapes to individual values of the field.</p>
    <div class="note">
      <p class="Information-Box--PACKT-">Shapes are images located in the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">My Tableau Repository\Shapes</code> directory. You can include your own custom shapes in subfolders of that directory by adding folders and image files.</p>
    </div>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-209" class="title">Marimekko charts</h1>
    <p class="normal">A <strong class="bold">Marimekko chart</strong> (sometimes alternately <a id="_idIndexMarker970"/>called a <strong class="bold">Mekko chart</strong>) is similar to a vertically <a id="_idIndexMarker971"/>stacked bar chart, but additionally uses varying widths of bars to communicate additional information about the data. Here, for example, is a <strong class="bold">Marimekko chart</strong> showing the breakdown of sales by region and department. </p>
    <p class="normal">The width of the bars communicates the total <strong class="screen-text">Sales for</strong> <strong class="screen-text">Region</strong>, while the height of each segment gives you the percentage of sales for the <strong class="screen-text">Department</strong> within the <strong class="screen-text">Region</strong>:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_10_11.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.11: The amount of sales per Department is indicated by the height of each segment, while the width of each bar indicates the overall sales per Region</p>
    <p class="normal">Creating <a id="_idIndexMarker972"/>Marimekko charts in Tableau leverages the ability to fix the width of bars according to the axis' units.</p>
    <div class="note">
      <p class="Information-Box--PACKT-">Clicking the <strong class="screen-text">Size</strong> shelf when a continuous (green) field is on <strong class="screen-text">Columns</strong> (thus defining a horizontal axis) and the mark type is set to <strong class="screen-text">Bar</strong> reveals options for a fixed size. You can manually enter a <strong class="screen-text">Size</strong> and <strong class="bold">Alignment</strong> or drop a field on the <strong class="screen-text">Size</strong> shelf to vary the width of the bars.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">Here are the steps required to create this kind of visualization:</p>
    <ol>
      <li class="list" value="1">The mark type has been specifically set to <strong class="screen-text">Bar</strong>.</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="screen-text">Region</strong> and <strong class="screen-text">Department</strong> have been placed on <strong class="screen-text">Color</strong> and <strong class="screen-text">Detail</strong>, respectively. They are the only dimensions in the view, so they define the view's<strong class="bold"> level of detail</strong>.</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="screen-text">Sales</strong> has been placed on <strong class="screen-text">Rows</strong> and a <strong class="screen-text">Percent of Total</strong> quick table calculation applied. The <strong class="bold">Compute Using</strong> (addressing) has been set to <strong class="screen-text">Department</strong> so that we get the percentage of sales for each department within the partition of the <strong class="screen-text">Region</strong>.</li>
      <li class="list" value="4">The calculated field <strong class="screen-text">Sales for Region</strong> calculates the <em class="italics">x </em>axis location for the right-side position of each bar. The code is as follows:
        <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">IF FIRST() = <span class="hljs-number">0</span> 
    THEN MIN({EXCLUDE [Department] : SUM(<span class="hljs-name">Sales</span>)}) 
ELSEIF LOOKUP(<span class="hljs-name">MIN</span>([Region]), <span class="hljs-number">-1</span>) &lt;&gt; MIN([Region]) 
    THEN PREVIOUS_VALUE(<span class="hljs-number">0</span>) + MIN({EXCLUDE [Department] : SUM(<span class="hljs-name">Sales</span>)}) 
ELSE 
    PREVIOUS_VALUE(<span class="hljs-number">0</span>) 
<span class="hljs-keyword">END</span>
</code></pre>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="normal">While this code may seem daunting at first, it follows a logical progression. Specifically, if this is the first bar segment, we'll want to know the sum of <strong class="screen-text">Sales</strong> for the entire region (which is why we exclude <strong class="screen-text">Department</strong> with an inline level of detail calculation). When the calculation moves to a new <strong class="screen-text">Region</strong>, we'll need to add the previous <strong class="screen-text">Region</strong> total to the new <strong class="screen-text">Region</strong> total. Otherwise, the calculation is for another segment in the same <strong class="screen-text">Region</strong>, so the regional total is the same as the previous segment. Notice again, the <strong class="screen-text">Compute Using</strong> option has been set to <strong class="screen-text">Department</strong> to enable the logical progression to work as expected.</p>
    <p class="normal">Finally, a few additional<a id="_idIndexMarker973"/> adjustments were made to the view:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="list">The field on <strong class="screen-text">Size</strong> is an ad hoc level of detail calculation with the code <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">{EXCLUDE [Department] : SUM(Sales)}</code>. As we mentioned earlier, this excludes <strong class="screen-text">Department</strong> and allows us to get the sum of sales at a <strong class="screen-text">Region</strong> level. This means that each bar is sized according to the total sales for the given <strong class="screen-text">Region</strong>.</li>
      <li class="list">Clicking on the <strong class="screen-text">Size</strong> shelf gives the option to set the alignment of the bars to Right. Since the preceding calculation gave the right position of the bar, we need to make certain the bars are drawn from that starting point.</li>
      <li class="list">Various fields, such as <strong class="screen-text">SUM(Sales)</strong> as an absolute value and percentage, have been copied to the <strong class="screen-text">Label</strong> shelf so that each bar segment more clearly communicates meaning to the viewer.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="packt_tip">
      <p>To add labels to each <strong class="screen-text">Region</strong> column, you might consider creating a second view and placing both on a dashboard. Alternately, you might use annotations.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">In addition to allowing you to create Marimekko charts, the ability to control the size of bars in axis units opens all kinds of possibilities for creating additional visualizations, such as complex cascade charts or stepped area charts. The techniques are like those used here. You may also leverage the sizing feature with <strong class="bold">continuous bins</strong> (use the drop-down menu to change a bin field in the view to continuous from discrete).</p>

    <h1 id="_idParaDest-210" class="title">Animated visualizations</h1>
    <p class="normal">Previous versions of <a id="_idIndexMarker975"/>Tableau allowed rudimentary animation using the <strong class="screen-text">Pages</strong> shelf with playback controls. Tableau 2020.1 introduced true <strong class="bold">Mark Animation</strong>, which <a id="_idIndexMarker976"/>means marks smoothly transition when you apply filters, sorting, or page changes. Consider leveraging animation to extend your analytical potential in a couple of ways:</p>
    <ol>
      <li class="list" value="1">Turn it on while exploring and analyzing your data. This allows you to gain analytical insights you might otherwise miss, such as seeing how far and in which direction marks in a scatterplot move as a filter changes.</li>
      <li class="list" value="2">Use it strategically to enhance the data story. Animation can be used to capture interest, draw attention to important elements, or build suspense toward a conclusion.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="normal">We'll consider both approaches to animation in the following examples.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-211" class="title">Enhancing analysis with animation</h2>
    <p class="normal">Consider the <a id="_idIndexMarker977"/>following bar chart, which shows the <a id="_idIndexMarker978"/>correlation of <strong class="screen-text">Sales</strong> and <strong class="screen-text">Profit</strong> for each <strong class="screen-text">Department</strong>:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_10_12.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.12: Sales and profit per Department</p>
    <p class="normal">Notice the <strong class="screen-text">Region</strong> filter. Change <a id="_idIndexMarker979"/>the filter selection a few times in the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Chapter 10</code> workbook. You'll observe the standard behavior that occurs without <a id="_idIndexMarker980"/>animations: the circle marks are immediately redrawn at the new location determined by the filter. This works well, but there is a bit of a disconnect between filter settings. As you switch between regions, notice the mental difficulty in keeping track of where a mark was versus where it is with the new selection. Did one region's mark increase in profit? Did it decrease in sales?</p>
    <p class="normal">Now, turn on animations for the view. To do this, use the menu to select <strong class="screen-text">Format </strong>|<strong class="screen-text"> Animations…</strong> The <strong class="screen-text">Animations</strong> format pane will show on the left. Use it to turn <strong class="screen-text">Animation</strong> on for the <strong class="screen-text">Selected Sheet</strong>:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_10_13.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.13: The Animations format pane gives various options for workbook and individual sheet animation settings</p>
    <p class="normal">Experiment with <a id="_idIndexMarker981"/>various duration settings and change the filter<a id="_idIndexMarker982"/> value. Notice how much easier it is to see the change in sales and profit from region to region. This gives you the ability to notice changes more easily. You'll start to gain insight, even without spending a lot of cognitive effort, into the magnitude and direction of change. Animations provide a path to this analytical insight.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-212" class="title">Enhancing data storytelling with animation</h2>
    <p class="normal">Beyond providing <a id="_idIndexMarker983"/>analytical insight as you perform your <a id="_idIndexMarker984"/>data discovery and analysis, you can also leverage animation to more effectively drive interest and highlight decision points, opportunities, or risks in your data stories. As an example, consider this view in the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Chapter 10</code> workbook:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B16021_10_14.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.14: O2 Tank 1 and 2 pressure readings over time during the Apollo 13 mission</p>
    <p class="normal">The view tells a part of the<a id="_idIndexMarker985"/> story of Apollo 13 and the disaster <a id="_idIndexMarker986"/>that crippled the spacecraft. It does this by making use of both the <strong class="screen-text">Pages</strong> shelf as well as smooth animation. Experiment with the animation speed and playback controls in the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Chapter 10</code> workbook. Consider how animation can be used to heighten awareness, drive interest, or even create suspense.</p>
    <div class="packt_tip">
      <p>When you use multiple views on a dashboard, each having the same combination of fields on the <strong class="screen-text">Pages</strong> shelf, you can synchronize the playback controls (using the caret drop-down menu on the playback controls) to create a fully animated dashboard.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">Animations can be <a id="_idIndexMarker987"/>shared with other users of Tableau Desktop<a id="_idIndexMarker988"/> and are displayed on Tableau Server, Tableau Online, and Tableau Public.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-213" class="title">Summary</h1>
    <p class="normal">We've covered a wide variety of advanced visualization types in this chapter! We've considered slope and bump charts that show changes in rank or value, step and jump lines that show discretely changing values, and unit charts that help materialize abstract concepts.</p>
    <p class="normal">There is no way to cover every possible visualization type. Instead, the idea has been to demonstrate some of what can be accomplished and spark new ideas and creativity. As you experiment and iterate through new ways of looking at data, you'll become more confident in how to best communicate the stories contained in the data. Next, we'll return briefly to the topic of dashboards to see how some advanced techniques can make them truly dynamic.</p>
