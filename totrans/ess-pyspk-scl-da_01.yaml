- en: Upon completion of this section, you will be able to ingest data from various
    data sources, cleanse it, integrate it, and write it out to persistent storage
    such as a data lake in a scalable and distributed manner. You will also be able
    to build real-time analytics pipelines and perform change data capture in a data
    lake. You will understand the key differences between the ETL and ELT ways of
    data processing, and how ELT evolved for the cloud-based data lake world. This
    section also introduces you to Delta Lake to make cloud-based data lakes more
    reliable and performant. You will understand the nuances of Lambda architecture
    as a means to perform simultaneous batch and real-time analytics and how Apache
    Spark combined with Delta Lake greatly simplifies Lambda architecture.
