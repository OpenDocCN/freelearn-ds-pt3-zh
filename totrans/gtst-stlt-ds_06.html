			<h1 id="_idParaDest-55"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor056"/>Chapter 5</em>: Deploying Streamlit with Streamlit Sharing</h1>
			<p>So far in this book, we have focused on Streamlit app development, from creating complex visualizations to deploying and creating <strong class="bold">machine learning</strong> (<strong class="bold">ML</strong>) models. In this chapter, we will learn how to deploy these applications so they can be shared with anyone with internet access. This is a crucial part of Streamlit apps, as, without the ability to deploy a Streamlit app, the friction still exists for users or consumers of your work. If we believe that Streamlit removes the friction between creating data science analysis/products/models and sharing them with others, then we must also believe that the ability to widely share apps is just as crucial as the ease of development. </p>
			<p>There are three main ways to deploy Streamlit apps: through a product created by Streamlit called <em class="italic">Streamlit Sharing</em>, through a cloud provider such as <em class="italic">Amazon Web Services</em> or <em class="italic">Heroku</em>, or through another product created by Streamlit called <em class="italic">Streamlit for Teams</em>. All three of these options are paid, but Streamlit Sharing has a free tier and Amazon Web Services regularly gives away free credit to students, first-time users, and start-ups, and Heroku has a free tier as well. The easiest and preferred method for most Streamlit users is Streamlit Sharing, so we will cover that directly here, and will cover Amazon Web Services, Heroku, and Streamlit for Teams later in this book, in <a href="B16864_08_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor081"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Deploying Streamlit Apps with Heroku and AWS</em>, and <a href="B16864_10_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor105"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></a>, <em class="italic">The Data Project – Prototyping Projects in Streamlit</em>.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Getting started with Streamlit Sharing</li>
				<li>A quick primer on GitHub</li>
				<li>Deploying with Streamlit Sharing</li>
				<li>Debugging Streamlit Sharing</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-56"><a id="_idTextAnchor057"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>This chapter requires access to Streamlit Sharing, which as of this writing is in beta. You can request Streamlit Sharing access at <a href="https://streamlit.io/sharing-sign-up">https://streamlit.io/sharing-sign-up</a>. They send out new admissions each week! If you are still waiting for Streamlit Sharing access and want to deploy an app immediately, feel free to move on to <a href="B16864_08_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor081"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Deploying Streamlit Apps with Heroku and AWS</em>, where we deploy on AWS and Heroku. </p>
			<p>This chapter also requires a free GitHub account, which can be attained at <a href="https://www.github.com">https://www.github.com</a>. A full Primer on GitHub, along with detailed setup instructions, can be found in the section <em class="italic">A quick primer on GitHub</em> later in this chapter.</p>
			<p>The code for this chapter can be found in the following GitHub repository:</p>
			<p><a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Getting-started-with-Streamlit-for-Data-Science&#13;">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Getting-started-with-Streamlit-for-Data-Science</a></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-57"><a id="_idTextAnchor058"/>Getting started with Streamlit Sharing</h1>
			<p>Streamlit Sharing<a id="_idIndexMarker185"/> is Streamlit's answer to a fast deployment process and is certainly my first recommendation for deploying your Streamlit applications. I remember the first time I deployed an app on Streamlit Sharing, I thought that there was no way that it was all that simple. We only need to push our code to a Github repository, point Streamlit to said repository, and it takes care of the rest. There are times when we care about "the rest," such as when we want to configure the amount of storage space or memory available, but often, letting Streamlit Sharing handle deployment, resourcing, and link creation makes our development significantly easier.</p>
			<p>The goal here will be to take the Palmer's penguins ML app we have already created and deploy it using Streamlit Sharing. Before we get started, Streamlit Sharing runs using GitHub. If you are already familiar with Git and GitHub, feel free to skip over this section and make a GitHub repository with our <strong class="source-inline">penguins_ml</strong> folder. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-58"><a id="_idTextAnchor059"/>A quick primer on GitHub</h1>
			<p>GitHub, and the<a id="_idIndexMarker186"/> language Git, are collaboration tools for software engineers and data scientists that provide a <a id="_idIndexMarker187"/>framework for version control. We do not need to know everything about how they work to use Streamlit Sharing, but we do need to be able to create our own repositories (which act like shared folders) and update them as we update our applications. There are two options for dealing with Git and GitHub, via the command line and via a product called GitHub Desktop. Primarily in this book, so far, we have stayed on the command line, and this tutorial will stick there. However, if you would like to use GitHub Desktop<a id="_idIndexMarker188"/> instead, head over to <a href="https://desktop.github.com">https://desktop.github.com</a> and follow along with the instructions provided there. </p>
			<p>Now, use the following steps to get started with Git and GitHub on the command line: </p>
			<ol>
				<li>First, go to <a href="https://www.github.com">https://www.github.com</a> and make <a id="_idIndexMarker189"/>a free account there. </li>
				<li>Then, we need to<a id="_idIndexMarker190"/> download the language Git onto our own computer and<a id="_idIndexMarker191"/> connect to our GitHub account with Git. We can do this on a Mac using <strong class="source-inline">brew</strong> in our terminal: <p class="source-code">brew install git</p></li>
				<li>We are also going to want to set a global username and email in Git (if we haven't already), which is recommended by GitHub. The following code sets these globally: <p class="source-code">git config --global user.name "My Name"</p><p class="source-code">git config --global user.email myemail@email.com</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Now that we have our GitHub account, and we also have Git installed locally, we need to create our first repository! We already have our folder with the files that we need inside it, called <strong class="source-inline">penguin_ml</strong>, so we <a id="_idIndexMarker192"/>should make sure that is the working directory we are working in (if you aren't sure, the command <strong class="source-inline">pwd</strong> will return our working directory). We are going to work with the final version <a id="_idIndexMarker193"/>of the <strong class="source-inline">penguins_streamlit.py</strong> app, which is shown with brief explanations for some context in the following code: </p>
			<p class="source-code">import streamlit as st</p>
			<p class="source-code">import seaborn as sns</p>
			<p class="source-code">import matplotlib.pyplot as plt</p>
			<p class="source-code">import pandas as pd</p>
			<p class="source-code">import pickle</p>
			<p class="source-code">st.title('Penguin Classifier')</p>
			<p class="source-code">st.write("This app uses 6 inputs to predict the species of penguin using "</p>
			<p class="source-code">         "a model built on the Palmer's Penguin's dataset. Use the form below"</p>
			<p class="source-code">         " to get started!")</p>
			<p class="source-code">penguin_df = pd.read_csv('penguins.csv')</p>
			<p class="source-code">rf_pickle = open('random_forest_penguin.pickle', 'rb')</p>
			<p class="source-code">map_pickle = open('output_penguin.pickle', 'rb')</p>
			<p class="source-code">rfc = pickle.load(rf_pickle)</p>
			<p class="source-code">unique_penguin_mapping = pickle.load(map_pickle)</p>
			<p class="source-code">rf_pickle.close()</p>
			<p class="source-code">map_pickle.close()</p>
			<p>This first section<a id="_idIndexMarker194"/> imports our libraries, sets up the titles for our app, and loads the model that we created using the <strong class="source-inline">penguins_ml.py</strong> file. This section will fail if we do not have the <strong class="source-inline">random_forest_penguin.pickle</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">output_penguin.pickle</strong> files. You can either go to <a href="B16864_04_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor049"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Using Machine Learning with Streamlit</em>, to create these files or head over to <a href="https://github.com/tylerjrichards/Getting-Started-with-Streamlit-for-Data-Science/tree/main/penguin_ml">https://github.com/tylerjrichards/Getting-Started-with-Streamlit-for-Data-Science/tree/main/penguin_ml</a> to find them directly: </p>
			<p class="source-code">with st.form('user_input'):</p>
			<p class="source-code">island = st.selectbox('Penguin Island', options=[</p>
			<p class="source-code">                      'Biscoe', 'Dream', 'Torgerson'])</p>
			<p class="source-code">sex = st.selectbox('Sex', options=['Female', 'Male'])</p>
			<p class="source-code">bill_length = st.number_input('Bill Length (mm)', min_value=0)</p>
			<p class="source-code">bill_depth = st.number_input('Bill Depth (mm)', min_value=0)</p>
			<p class="source-code">flipper_length = st.number_input('Flipper Length (mm)', min_value=0)</p>
			<p class="source-code">body_mass = st.number_input('Body Mass (g)', min_value=0)</p>
			<p class="source-code">st.form_submit_button()</p>
			<p class="source-code">island_biscoe, island_dream, island_torgerson = 0, 0, 0</p>
			<p class="source-code">if island == 'Biscoe':</p>
			<p class="source-code">    island_biscoe = 1</p>
			<p class="source-code">elif island == 'Dream':</p>
			<p class="source-code">    island_dream = 1</p>
			<p class="source-code">elif island == 'Torgerson':</p>
			<p class="source-code">    island_torgerson = 1</p>
			<p class="source-code">sex_female, sex_male = 0, 0</p>
			<p class="source-code">if sex == 'Female':</p>
			<p class="source-code">    sex_female = 1</p>
			<p class="source-code">elif sex == 'Male':</p>
			<p class="source-code">    sex_male = 1</p>
			<p class="source-code">new_prediction = rfc.predict([[bill_length, bill_depth, flipper_length,</p>
			<p class="source-code">                               body_mass, island_biscoe, island_dream,</p>
			<p class="source-code">                               island_torgerson, sex_female, sex_male]])</p>
			<p class="source-code">prediction_species = unique_penguin_mapping[new_prediction][0]</p>
			<p>This next section grabs <a id="_idIndexMarker195"/>all the user input we need for our prediction, from the island the researcher is on to the sex of the penguin, to the penguin's bill and flipper measurements, which prepares us for the predicting of the penguin species in the following code:</p>
			<p class="source-code">st.subheader("Predicting Your Penguin's Species:")</p>
			<p class="source-code">st.write('We predict your penguin is of the {} species'</p>
			<p class="source-code">         .format(prediction_species))</p>
			<p class="source-code">st.write('We used a machine learning (Random Forest) model to '</p>
			<p class="source-code">         'predict the species, the features used in this prediction '</p>
			<p class="source-code">         ' are ranked by relative importance below.')</p>
			<p class="source-code">st.image('feature_importance.png')</p>
			<p>And now this final section creates multiple histograms to explain the prediction by the model, showing the bill length/bill depth/flipper length separated by the species in hue. We use those three <a id="_idIndexMarker196"/>variables because our feature importance graph told us those were the best predictors of species in <a href="B16864_04_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor049"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Using Machine Learning with Streamlit</em>: </p>
			<p class="source-code">st.write('Below are the histograms for each continuous variable '</p>
			<p class="source-code">         'separated by penguin species. The vertical line '</p>
			<p class="source-code">         'represents your the inputted value.')</p>
			<p class="source-code">fig, ax = plt.subplots()</p>
			<p class="source-code">ax = sns.displot(x=penguin_df['bill_length_mm'],</p>
			<p class="source-code">                 hue=penguin_df['species'])</p>
			<p class="source-code">plt.axvline(bill_length)</p>
			<p class="source-code">plt.title('Bill Length by Species')</p>
			<p class="source-code">st.pyplot(ax)</p>
			<p class="source-code">fig, ax = plt.subplots()</p>
			<p class="source-code">ax = sns.displot(x=penguin_df['bill_depth_mm'],</p>
			<p class="source-code">                 hue=penguin_df['species'])</p>
			<p class="source-code">plt.axvline(bill_depth)</p>
			<p class="source-code">plt.title('Bill Depth by Species')</p>
			<p class="source-code">st.pyplot(ax)</p>
			<p class="source-code">fig, ax = plt.subplots()</p>
			<p class="source-code">ax = sns.displot(x=penguin_df['flipper_length_mm'],</p>
			<p class="source-code">                 hue=penguin_df['species'])</p>
			<p class="source-code">plt.axvline(flipper_length)</p>
			<p class="source-code">plt.title('Flipper Length by Species')</p>
			<p class="source-code">st.pyplot(ax)</p>
			<p>Now that we are in the correct folder with the right files, we will use the following code to initialize our first repository, and to add and then commit all our files to the repository: </p>
			<p class="source-code">git init </p>
			<p class="source-code">git add .</p>
			<p class="source-code">git commit -m 'our first repo commit'</p>
			<p>Our next step is to connect the <a id="_idIndexMarker197"/>Git repository on our local device to our GitHub account: </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">First, we need to set up a new repository by going back to the GitHub website and clicking the <strong class="bold">New repository</strong> button as shown in the following screenshot: <div id="_idContainer046" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/B16864_05_01.jpg" alt="Figure 5.1 – Setting up a new repository&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.1 – Setting up a new repository</p></li>
				<li>We can then fill out our repository name (<strong class="source-inline">penguin_ml</strong>), and click <strong class="bold">Create repository</strong>:<div id="_idContainer047" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/B16864_05_02.jpg" alt="Figure 5.2 – Repo creation &#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.2 – Repo creation </p></li>
				<li>Now that we have a <a id="_idIndexMarker198"/>new repository on GitHub, and also a repository locally, we need to connect the two. The following code connects the two repositories and pushes our code to the GitHub repo, GitHub also suggests how to connect two repositories after you click <strong class="bold">Create repository</strong>:<p class="source-code">git branch -M main</p><p class="source-code">git remote add origin https://github.com/{insert_username}/penguin_ml.git</p><p class="source-code">git push -u origin main</p><p>We should now see our <strong class="source-inline">penguin_ml</strong> files in our GitHub! If and when we have new code to push to our repository, we can follow the general format of using <strong class="source-inline">git add .</strong> to add the file changes, <strong class="source-inline">git commit –m "commit message",</strong> and then finally <strong class="source-inline">git push</strong> to push the changes to our repository. </p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>We can now move on to the deployment process on the Streamlit side. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-59"><a id="_idTextAnchor060"/>Deploying with Streamlit Sharing</h1>
			<p>Now that all our necessary files are <a id="_idIndexMarker199"/>in the GitHub repository, we have almost all that we need to deploy our application. You can use the following list of steps to deploy our application:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">When we deploy to Streamlit Sharing, Streamlit uses its own servers to host the app. Because of this, we need to explicitly tell Streamlit which Python libraries are required for our app to run. The following code installs a very helpful library called <strong class="source-inline">pipreqs</strong> and creates a <strong class="source-inline">requirements.txt</strong> file in the format we need for Streamlit: <p class="source-code">pip install pipreqs</p><p class="source-code">pipreqs .</p></li>
				<li>When we look at our <strong class="source-inline">requirements.txt</strong> file, we can see that <strong class="source-inline">pipreqs</strong> looked through all of our Python files and checked what we imported and used, and created a file that Streamlit can use to install the exact same versions of our libraries to prevent errors: <div id="_idContainer048" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/B16864_05_03.jpg" alt="Figure 5.3 – Requirements.txt&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.3 – Requirements.txt</p></li>
				<li>We have a new file, so we need to also add it to our GitHub repository. The following code adds <strong class="source-inline">requirements.txt</strong> to our repository: <p class="source-code">git add requirements.txt</p><p class="source-code">git commit -m 'add requirements file'</p><p class="source-code">git push</p></li>
				<li>Now, our last step is to sign up for Streamlit Sharing (<a href="http://share.streamlit.io">share.streamlit.io</a>) and click the <strong class="bold">New App</strong> button. After that, we can point Streamlit Sharing directly to our Python file that hosts our app's code, which in our case is called <strong class="source-inline">penguins_streamlit.py</strong>. You should also change the username from my personal GitHub <a id="_idIndexMarker200"/>username (<strong class="source-inline">tylerjrichards</strong>) to your own: <div id="_idContainer049" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/B16864_05_04.jpg" alt="Figure 5.4 – Adding URLs&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.4 – Adding URLs</p><p>After the app builds, we have a fully deployed Streamlit app. Whenever we make changes to the GitHub repository, we will see our changes. For example, the following code makes a change to the title of our app (for brevity, we will only show enough code to illustrate the change):</p><p class="source-code">import streamlit as st</p><p class="source-code">import seaborn as sns</p><p class="source-code">import matplotlib.pyplot as plt</p><p class="source-code">import pandas as pd</p><p class="source-code">import pickle</p><p class="source-code">st.title('Penguin Classifier: A Machine Learning App')</p><p class="source-code">st.write("This app uses 6 inputs to predict the species of penguin using "</p><p class="source-code">         "a model built on the Palmer's Penguin's dataset. Use the form below"</p><p class="source-code">         " to get started!")</p><p class="source-code">penguin_df = pd.read_csv('penguins.csv')</p><p class="source-code">rf_pickle = open('random_forest_penguin.pickle', 'rb')</p><p class="source-code">map_pickle = open('output_penguin.pickle', 'rb')</p><p class="source-code">rfc = pickle.load(rf_pickle)</p><p class="source-code">unique_penguin_mapping = pickle.load(map_pickle)</p><p class="source-code">rf_pickle.close()</p><p class="source-code">map_pickle.close()</p></li>
				<li>Now, to push the<a id="_idIndexMarker201"/> change, we need to update our GitHub repository. We will do that using the following code: <p class="source-code">git add .</p><p class="source-code">git commit -m 'changed our title'</p><p class="source-code">git push</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>When we go back to our app, your app will have its own unique URL. If you ever cannot find your Streamlit apps, you can always find them at <a href="http://share.streamlit.io">share.streamlit.io</a>. Now the top of our app should look like the following screenshot: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer050" class="IMG---Figure">

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.5 – Our deployed Streamlit app</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">It may take a couple of minutes for the app to reload! </p>
			<p>Now we have a fully <a id="_idIndexMarker202"/>deployed Streamlit app! We can share this link with friends, with colleagues, or on social media sites such as Twitter (if you make an interesting Streamlit app with the help of this book, please tweet it at me <em class="italic">@tylerjrichards</em>, I would love to see it!). Now, to learn how to debug our Streamlit apps. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-60"><a id="_idTextAnchor061"/>Debugging Streamlit Sharing</h1>
			<p>Streamlit Sharing<a id="_idIndexMarker203"/> also gives us access to the logs of our apps themselves, which will show up on our terminal if we are deploying our apps locally. At the bottom right, whenever we are viewing our own applications, there is a <strong class="bold">Manage Application</strong> button, which allows us to access our logs. From this menu of options, we can reboot, delete, or download logs from our app, along with viewing our other available apps and logging out from Streamlit. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-61"><a id="_idTextAnchor062"/>Streamlit Secrets</h2>
			<p>When creating and deploying <a id="_idIndexMarker204"/>Streamlit apps, you may want to use some information that is not viewable by the user of your app. The default in Streamlit Sharing is for public GitHub repositories with entirely public code, data, and models. But if, say, you want to use a private API key as many APIs (for example, Twitter's scraping API, or the Google Maps API) require, or want to programmatically access data stored in a password protected database, or even if you would like to password protect your Streamlit app, you need a way to expose a bit of data to Streamlit that is private. Streamlit's answer to this is Streamlit Secrets, which lets us set hidden and private "secrets" in each app. Let's start with password protecting our Streamlit applications, specifically our existing penguin app. </p>
			<p>To start out, we can edit the top of our app to require the user to enter a password before the rest of the application loads. We can use the <strong class="source-inline">st.stop()</strong> function to stop the app from running if the password is incorrect using the following code:</p>
			<p class="source-code">import streamlit as st</p>
			<p class="source-code">import seaborn as sns</p>
			<p class="source-code">import matplotlib.pyplot as plt</p>
			<p class="source-code">import pandas as pd</p>
			<p class="source-code">import pickle</p>
			<p class="source-code">from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score</p>
			<p class="source-code">from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier</p>
			<p class="source-code">from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split</p>
			<p class="source-code"> </p>
			<p class="source-code">st.title('Penguin Classifier')</p>
			<p class="source-code">st.write("This app uses 6 inputs to predict the species of penguin using "</p>
			<p class="source-code">         "a model built on the Palmer's Penguin's dataset. Use the form below"</p>
			<p class="source-code">         " to get started!")</p>
			<p class="source-code"> </p>
			<p class="source-code">password_guess = st.text_input('What is the Password?')</p>
			<p class="source-code">if password_guess != 'streamlit_password':</p>
			<p class="source-code">  st.stop()</p>
			<p class="source-code">penguin_file = st.file_uploader('Upload your own penguin data')</p>
			<p>This code will result in the next screenshot, and the rest will only load if the user inputs the string <strong class="source-inline">streamlit_password</strong> in the text input box:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer051" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16864_05_06.jpg" alt="Figure 5.6 – Password checker&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.6 – Password checker</p>
			<p>To create a Streamlit Secret, we<a id="_idIndexMarker205"/> just need to head over to our Streamlit Sharing main page at <a href="https://share.streamlit.io/">https://share.streamlit.io/</a>, and click the <strong class="bold">Edit secrets</strong> option, as shown in the next screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer052" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16864_05_07.jpg" alt="Figure 5.7 – Secrets&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.7 – Secrets</p>
			<p>Once we click the <strong class="bold">Edit secrets</strong> button, we <a id="_idIndexMarker206"/>can add new Streamlit Secrets to our app: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer053" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16864_05_08.jpg" alt="Figure 5.8 – Our first Streamlit Secret&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.8 – Our first Streamlit Secret</p>
			<p>Our last step is <a id="_idIndexMarker207"/>to read Streamlit Secrets from our deployed app within our code, which we can do by calling <strong class="source-inline">st.secrets</strong> and calling the variable we created in Secrets. The following code replaces our hardcoded password with the Streamlit Secret:</p>
			<p class="source-code">st.title('Penguin Classifier')</p>
			<p class="source-code">st.write("This app uses 6 inputs to predict the species of penguin using "</p>
			<p class="source-code">         "a model built on the Palmer's Penguin's dataset. Use the form below"</p>
			<p class="source-code">         " to get started!")</p>
			<p class="source-code"> </p>
			<p class="source-code">password_guess = st.text_input('What is the Password?')</p>
			<p class="source-code">if password_guess != st.secrets["password"]:</p>
			<p class="source-code">  st.stop()</p>
			<p class="source-code"> </p>
			<p class="source-code">penguin_file = st.file_uploader('Upload your own penguin data')</p>
			<p>This code will create the <a id="_idIndexMarker208"/>following Streamlit app, password protected with the Streamlit Secret that we set: </p>

			<p>When we push this code to our GitHub repository and reboot our Streamlit app, we will then have a password-protected Streamlit app deployed on Streamlit Sharing! We can use this same method for private API keys, or any other use case where we need to hide data from the user of the app. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-62"><a id="_idTextAnchor063"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we've learned how to get started with Git and GitHub on the command line, how to debug apps on Streamlit Sharing, how to use Streamlit Secrets to use private data on public apps, and how to deploy our apps quickly using Streamlit Sharing. This completes part one of this book! Congratulations for making it to this point. The next section will use all of part one as a building block for more advanced topics such as more complicated formatting and beautification of our Streamlit apps and using valuable open source community-built add-ons called Streamlit components. </p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will cover beautifying Streamlit apps through themes, columns, and many more features. </p>
