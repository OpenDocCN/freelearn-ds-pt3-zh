    of performing data analysis and machine learning tasks entirely in Python. We
    began our journey by learning about some introductory statistics and how to set
    up our environment for data science in Python. Then, we learned about the basics
    of using `pandas` and how to bring data into Python. With this knowledge, we were
    able to work with APIs, read from files, and query databases to grab data for
    our analyses.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After we collected our data, we learned how to perform data wrangling in order
    to clean up our data and get it into a usable format. Next, we learned how to
    work with time series and combine data from different sources as well as aggregate
    it. Once we had a good handle on data wrangling, we moved on to visualizations
    and used `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` to create a variety of plot types,
    and we also learned how to customize them.

    looking at the financial data for bitcoin and the FAANG stocks and trying to detect
    hackers attempting to authenticate to a web application. In addition, we learned
    how to build our own Python packages, write our own classes, and simulate data.

- en: Finally, we got an introduction to machine learning using `scikit-learn`. We
    discussed how to build model pipelines, taking us from preprocessing the data
    through to model fitting. Afterward, we discussed how we can evaluate the performance
    of our models and how we can try to improve their performance. Our discussion
    of machine learning culminated in using machine learning models to detect hackers
    attempting to gain access to a web application through a brute-force attack.
