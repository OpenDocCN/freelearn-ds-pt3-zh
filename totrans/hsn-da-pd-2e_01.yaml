- en: Our journey begins with an introduction to data analysis and statistics, which
    will lay a strong foundation for the concepts we will cover throughout the book.
    Then, we will set up our Python data science environment, which contains everything
    we will need to work through the examples, and get started with learning the basics
    of `pandas`.
