    left out of the conversation. All companies have some sort of operational function
    focused on data, but they are often not visible to leaders. Data operations teams
    are often stuck behind visualization teams or governance functions, unknown to
    the company. What are they really? What do data operations teams provide to the
    company?

    focus the value data operations bring to your organization and how you can show
    measurable value to the executives you interact with.
