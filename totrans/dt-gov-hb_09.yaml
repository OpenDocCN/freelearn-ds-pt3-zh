    understand the benefits of data architecture, or they may not even be aware of
    it. Many organizations are focused on short-term gains, such as meeting quarterly
    revenue targets. Data architecture is often seen as a long-term investment, and
    it can be difficult to justify the cost and effort upfront. It’s also an expensive
    endeavor to change, and thus, most companies lack the patience and focus to have
    the long-range plan realized. Furthermore, data architecture can be complex, and
    it can be difficult to know where to start. This can be especially challenging
    for smaller organizations with limited resources. There is also a shortage of
    skilled data architects, and it can be difficult to find and hire qualified candidates.

    technology and tooling, and what integration patterns are used across the organization,
    in alignment with the design principles established previously. Business and technical
    data stewards should play an active role in designing data architectural standards
    so that their needs are met. Remember—these standards will set the evolution of
    data architecture and will not change everything overnight. They should serve
    as the North Star by which all future design choices are held.

    the power of collective architecture across a company to enable the highest levels
    of optimization with technology and data investments. Both *could have* been more
    successful.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In both cases, the programs successfully and ruthlessly defined specific design
    principles by which the to-be architecture was defined; for example, tight expectations
    around the mandated use of reference data across the entire company, from a single
    source of truth. The result of this expectation would have led to a significant
    uplift in efficiency and ease in data aggregation enterprise-wide. However, in
    practice, the company was “softer” about the requirements of adoption. We entered
    the transformation with a firm expectation that we would require conformity and
    adoption of reference data within a 24-month period, but by the time we exited
    the program, we had relaxed this expectation to require the adoption of reference
    data only when “major” updates to the platforms occurred, which meant that the
    true benefit of reference data adoption would take years (5+). As with any long-term
    program, the momentum was lost, and the benefits were not realized early.

    to drive change. These changes are very expensive and require clear focus to achieve
    the **return on investment** (**ROI**) desired.

- en: One of the best ways to establish a strong architecture is to tightly integrate
    with business architecture, data architecture, and IT architecture. Most companies
    do not have a strong business architecture function. However, it can be the best
    way to evaluate the way in which the business operations should flow, the data
    that is required to support it, and the technology that will enable optimal operations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The best practice would be to establish an **architectural council**. This should
    have representation from business, architecture, data, architecture, and IT architecture.
    Most companies do not focus on bringing these three types of architectural experts
    together, and therefore, when there are requirements for the business, data, or
    IT, they are often not considered holistically. By bringing these functions together,
    the company has an opportunity to streamline the design of simplistic and effective
    solutions.

- en: Most companies do not focus on business architecture or assume it’s happening
    as a part of basic operations. It’s not. The architectural council can ensure
    that any architectural designs holistically account for all three vantage points.
    Selfishly, this ensures that data architecture is designed in a way that supports
    both optimal business processes and technology well. If either of these two other
    related architectural perspectives is not designed well, data architecture will
    not be effective. Thus, if your company does not have an architectural council,
    advocate for one. Ideally, this would be chaired by your chief architect and have
    representation across the business, inclusive of all three types of architecture.

    and the support to transition in a few years. In reality, that is unlikely. Depending
    on the size, scale, and historical decisions of your company, the as-is state
    may be very difficult to unwind. You are going to be building the plane while
    it’s flying, which makes these types of programs extremely complex. Because of
    this, it’s much more common to see organizations build to-be design principles
    into the **systems development life cycle** (**SDLC**), for adoption over time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The only way this will succeed, and that there will be a completion/end date
    to this program, is for a champion to continue to vocally drive the business value
    of the to-be state, have teeth in ensuring the to-be state is followed, and have
    the support of the executive team to make it happen. This can’t be followed only
    when it’s easy; it must also be followed when it is hard. The chief information
    officer can be a great advocate for you in this goal, as they typically hold the
    authority to approve or reject technical architecture in terms of programs. Ensure
    you have their full and unwavering support to bind the company to adopt the SDLC
    for optimal success.
