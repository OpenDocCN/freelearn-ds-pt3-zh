			<h1 id="_idParaDest-136"><a id="_idTextAnchor135"/>Metadata Management</h1>
			<p>This chapter is intended for anyone interested in learning more about metadata management at a high level, understanding optimal implementation strategies, or anything in between. It is not necessary to have any prior experience with metadata management to understand the material in <span class="No-Break">this chapter.</span></p>
			<p>Establishing a high-value, high-return metadata management capability is absolutely required for any data governance program. The success or failure of a chief data &amp; analytics officer hinges on being able to answer a few fundamental, core questions: Where is the company’s data? Who owns it? How is it classified? Is it safe &amp; secure? Can I leverage it for value? Do I know how to reduce data risk? You will learn the answers to these questions and be guided through how to tactically set up a metadata management capability for success as we dive into the critical capability <span class="No-Break">of metadata.</span></p>
			<p>Simply put, metadata is information about data. Metadata capabilities are used to make data more understandable, accessible, and reusable. Metadata management is the process of creating, storing, organizing, maintaining, and using metadata. In my experience, metadata is one of the most underappreciated data capabilities, but it is foundational to any data management program. Metadata is the root of success when deployed and managed well and the root of failure when underfunded <span class="No-Break">and underutilized.</span></p>
			<p>Metadata management is important for a number of reasons. First, it can help to improve the quality of data. By providing information about the data, metadata can help to ensure that it is accurate, complete, and consistent. Second, metadata can help to make data more accessible. By providing ways to search and filter metadata, users can more easily find the data they need. Third, metadata can help to make data <span class="No-Break">more reusable.</span></p>
			<p>By providing information about the data’s context and usage, metadata can help users understand how the data can be used in different scenarios. In this chapter, we will cover <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Metadata <span class="No-Break">management defined</span></li>
				<li>The value of <span class="No-Break">metadata management</span></li>
				<li>Core <span class="No-Break">metadata capabilities</span></li>
				<li>Building optimal <span class="No-Break">metadata capability</span></li>
				<li>Setting up metadata management <span class="No-Break">for success</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-137"><a id="_idTextAnchor136"/>Metadata management defined</h1>
			<p>Before we get into the details, I find it important to align on basic definitions. In my experience, data professionals <a id="_idIndexMarker365"/>sometimes skip basic definitions in an attempt not to insult the audience when launching data capabilities. However, starting with grounding definitions can be done with grace in a way that does not insult the business leader and still grounds the audience on what we <span class="No-Break">will accomplish.</span></p>
			<p>I like to start with a simple slide with the title “Before we begin.” This simple yet impactful grounding slide can be set up with a basic premise and with the following verbal statement: “Before we dig into the details, I want to spend just a moment ensuring we all have the same common understanding of what it is we are going to discuss today. I, for one, have not been a metadata expert all my life, and thus, let’s take a moment to define what it is we mean when we talk about metadata today.” This simple yet non-offensive grounding centers the team on the definition together without sounding like we are preaching to <span class="No-Break">our stakeholders.</span></p>
			<p>So, to that end, before we begin, let’s ground on definitions. When we talk about <strong class="bold">metadata</strong>, it’s important to state<a id="_idIndexMarker366"/> that all metadata is, is information about our data. You may hear it described as data about data. It’s not enough to capture data about data, we must put it into action, and that requires <span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">metadata management</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-138"><a id="_idTextAnchor137"/>What is metadata management?</h2>
			<p>Metadata management is a <a id="_idIndexMarker367"/>foundational capability that every company needs to understand and manage. Effective metadata management capabilities tell users basic information about the data, including <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>What <span class="No-Break">data exists</span></li>
				<li>Who created <span class="No-Break">the data</span></li>
				<li>When the data <span class="No-Break">was created</span></li>
				<li>Where the data <span class="No-Break">was created</span></li>
				<li>What the <span class="No-Break">data means</span></li>
				<li>Where the data <span class="No-Break">comes from</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Metadata can<a id="_idIndexMarker368"/> be used to do many things, but at a minimum, it helps users to do <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Discover <span class="No-Break">data assets</span></li>
				<li>Understand <span class="No-Break">data context</span></li>
				<li>Build trust in <span class="No-Break">the information</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Consume data</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>There are three types of metadata that require active management: business metadata, technical metadata, and operational metadata. Together, these three types of metadata allow for data assets to be better understood and enable additional value to be unlocked from the data. Let’s start with some <span class="No-Break">basic definitions.</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Business metadata</strong>: This connects<a id="_idIndexMarker369"/> data domains to business data stewards, drives<a id="_idIndexMarker370"/> business data definitions, and is responsible for linking business metadata to the technical metadata across <span class="No-Break">the enterprise.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Technical metadata</strong>: This contains the <a id="_idIndexMarker371"/>physical data elements and <a id="_idIndexMarker372"/>attributes from physical data, enables data tracing, and drives an understanding of any data transformations. Technical metadata shows us where the data came from in terms of the physical databases, systems, and data flows across the enterprise. Technical metadata also describes the data structure, storage, format, and processing. This type of metadata usually includes data such as data types, column names, and <span class="No-Break">table structures.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Operational metadata</strong>: This contains information about how and when the data was created or transformed. It may include<a id="_idIndexMarker373"/> information such as time<a id="_idIndexMarker374"/> stamps, location, or job <span class="No-Break">execution logs.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>All three of these types of metadata are important for strong data management. They serve different purposes and are typically used by different users (e.g., business metadata is usually used in service of business data stewards, whereas technical metadata is more critical to the technical data <span class="No-Break">steward persona).</span></p>
			<h3>Examples of metadata</h3>
			<p>Let’s bring these definitions<a id="_idIndexMarker375"/> to life. Let’s start with metadata about structured data, such as a customer data record, as shown in a database table for the Customer <span class="No-Break">Data platform:</span></p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-139"><a id="_idTextAnchor138"/>The value of metadata management</h1>
			<p>When I think about the value of data management capabilities, I think about value in terms of what can I do after I deploy<a id="_idIndexMarker382"/> this capability that I am not able to do today. How do I measure this difference? It may be in dollars saved, fines avoided, hours of employee time that is saved, revenue that is generated, opportunity value unlocked, or some combination thereof. Any of these value vectors can make the capability <span class="No-Break">worth deploying.</span></p>
			<p>The difference with metadata is that subsequent data management capabilities (as we will explore in <em class="italic">Chapters</em> <em class="italic">7</em>–<em class="italic">11</em>) will not reach their full potential without metadata capabilities in place. Thus, this capability is foundational, which also needs to be accounted for when measuring the value of metadata management. There are five core tenants to the value of metadata <span class="No-Break">management capabilities:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Transparency</strong>: Metadata management enables transparency about the data. Technical metadata tells us where the data came from, the systems the data was sourced from, if it was transposed or otherwise changed, and enables us to understand the data better. When we know more about the data’s journey, we have increased transparency about the data, and therefore, higher trust in <span class="No-Break">the data.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Stewardship</strong>: Metadata management enables us to drive the accountability of the data. When we know what data we have, we can assign data stewards to the data, which enables accountability. When we know who is responsible for the data, we can create an environment where there is a point of contact to take care of the data for the company’s use. This model of stewardship enables the company to be able to identify any responsible parties and drive further accountability for the <a id="_idIndexMarker383"/>management of the data. When stewards exist and have clear roles and responsibilities (as we outlined in the data governance policy), then the company gets to reap the rewards from the additional care over <span class="No-Break">the data.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">Remember, the key to high-quality stewardship is that of a service provider, not a data owner. The concept of ownership can lead to a “scarcity” mindset, which will prevent the stewards from sharing the data. Data represent an enterprise asset and should be available for shared use unless privacy, legal, or other regulations require confidentiality over the <span class="No-Break">data assets.</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Clarity</strong>: Metadata management enables the company to gain clarity about terminology, sourcing, and ownership. By driving clarity, business units, analysts, engineers, and executives alike can align <span class="No-Break">with ease.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Reusability</strong>: Metadata management enables the company to locate, understand, and use (and reuse) enterprise <span class="No-Break">data assets.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Foundational Capability</strong>: Metadata management is a key foundational capability that is required for subsequent data management capabilities such as data quality, architecture optimization, and data operations. If we don’t know what data we have, it’s very hard to measure the quality of it, optimize sourcing, or manage it as a part of general data operations. We must have high-quality, reliable, and accessible metadata to drive these <span class="No-Break">additional capabilities.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-140"><a id="_idTextAnchor139"/>Why does metadata matter?</h2>
			<p>Metadata management provides the necessary capabilities to establish informational understanding and organization in a company. The active nature of metadata management allows a company to <a id="_idIndexMarker384"/>foster the use of data assets through sharing, enabling insights into data for change management, and allowing for the appropriate control and protection of regulation, policy adherence, and <span class="No-Break">overall compliance.</span></p>
			<p>The business outcomes that you can expect to drive through building out metadata management capabilities include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>The ability to <strong class="bold">search and locate</strong> both business and technical data (saving the data user hours or potentially weeks of trying to<a id="_idIndexMarker385"/> find the data through their own internal social network, asking colleagues where the data and multiple iterations are when attempting to find the best source for <span class="No-Break">that data)</span></li>
				<li>The ability to <strong class="bold">rationalize common terms</strong> enterprise-wide (aligning the business to a <span class="No-Break">common taxonomy)</span></li>
				<li>The ability to <strong class="bold">manage data well</strong> and feed other key data management capabilities, such as governance, data quality, data architecture, and primary <span class="No-Break">data management</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-141"><a id="_idTextAnchor140"/>Core metadata capabilities</h1>
			<p>Business metadata capabilities should be led by the data management solutions team under the office of the Chief Data &amp; Analytics Officer. Business metadata must be driven centrally and should partner closely with<a id="_idIndexMarker386"/> business data stewards across the company to deliver end-to-end metadata process and technology solutions, including the tooling and processes required to enable business value from metadata management. In this section, we will cover the core capabilities that the data management solutions team is responsible for when deploying and <span class="No-Break">managing enterprise-wide.</span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-142"><a id="_idTextAnchor141"/>Metadata standards</h2>
			<p>Metadata standards are the guidelines or<a id="_idIndexMarker387"/> expectations for how the company<a id="_idIndexMarker388"/> should create, manage, and use metadata. These standards help companies define what must be done for data assets, systems, processes, and use such that there is consistency enterprise-wide and that the metadata<a id="_idIndexMarker389"/> can be <span class="No-Break">relied upon.</span></p>
			<h3>Why do metadata standards matter?</h3>
			<p>Metadata standards are critical to the success of metadata management because the standards align expectations for how metadata management will be deployed, used, and leveraged across a company. There<a id="_idIndexMarker390"/> are four core tenants of a metadata management standard, and the following should be addressed in full in <span class="No-Break">the standard:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Metadata is an enterprise asset that has value and should be <span class="No-Break">managed accordingly.</span></li>
				<li>Metadata management is an enterprise-wide capability and requires <span class="No-Break">enterprise-wide leadership.</span></li>
				<li>Accountability is required; no one person or team can drive enterprise-wide metadata management alone or <span class="No-Break">in isolation.</span></li>
				<li>Decisions around metadata management must be made through an enterprise lens and not in favor of one user or one group above the greater good of <span class="No-Break">the enterprise</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>How to measure progress</h3>
			<p>A simple way to measure the progress of the deployment of metadata standards is two-fold: the publication of the standards and the adoption of the standards. For publication, you are seeking to publish <a id="_idIndexMarker391"/>one standard for the enterprise. There’s no need to measure much beyond the publication date meeting the expected publication date and any regular revisions being <span class="No-Break">on track.</span></p>
			<p>The second measure of success is the adoption of the standard. You can set adoption metrics by division, data domain, system, or business data steward—whatever makes sense for your data management program. The important component is consistency across data management capabilities. If you are measuring by data domain, for example, measure all your data management capabilities by data domain to drive consistency <span class="No-Break">in adoption.</span></p>
			<h3>Who manages metadata standards?</h3>
			<p>The office of the Chief Data &amp; Analytics Officer is ultimately responsible for the business glossary for the company. Within the <a id="_idIndexMarker392"/>office of the CDAO, the data management solutions team, which manages all the metadata, data quality, and primary data, should drive the requirements that feed the metadata standards; however, generally, your data governance leader will be responsible for publishing all enterprise data standards through a consistent process and will ultimately be publishing the <span class="No-Break">metadata standards.</span></p>
			<p>The data governance Leader may also manage compliance against the company’s data standards, with the metadata management leader being accountable for progress in deployment and adoption. Business and technical data stewards should be consulted in the development of the standards. Data domain executives should be informed about <span class="No-Break">the standards.</span></p>
			<h3>How should you use it?</h3>
			<p>The metadata standards should be used to guide users on what is required for metadata management, defining the capabilities, what<a id="_idIndexMarker393"/> solutions are available to aid them in both complying with the standard, and also using metadata management. The standard should define the key terms, establish processes, inform users on what metadata tools should be used, and, overall, drive enablement to use this key data <span class="No-Break">management capability.</span></p>
			<p>In some organizations, the metadata standard may also inform the reader about the funding requirements, change management, and what is out of the scope of <span class="No-Break">the standard.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-143"><a id="_idTextAnchor142"/>Business glossary</h2>
			<p>Business glossaries and data catalogs both represent key metadata management capabilities, but they have different purposes and generally serve slightly different audiences. A <strong class="bold">business glossary</strong> is a lot like a common dictionary—it creates clarity. It contains the key business terms and their definitions <a id="_idIndexMarker394"/>for the data that matters to your company. The business glossary should provide search capabilities to <a id="_idIndexMarker395"/>enable users to search and find the data they are looking for, enable an understanding of the key characteristics of the data, and drive some level of workflow to suggest changes and approve the <span class="No-Break">business metadata.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">Sometimes a business glossary is referred to as a<a id="_idIndexMarker396"/> <span class="No-Break">data dictionary.</span></p>
			<p>Business glossaries are<a id="_idIndexMarker397"/> typically used by business users (but technical users may also benefit from their use) to help drive understanding and meaning about data, and they typically capture the <span class="No-Break">following information:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Terms</strong>: What we <span class="No-Break">are defining</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Definition</strong>: A clear and concise description of <span class="No-Break">the term</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Synonyms</strong>: Other terms that have the same meaning as <span class="No-Break">the term</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Antonyms</strong>: Other terms that have the opposite meaning as <span class="No-Break">the term</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Examples</strong>: Examples of how the term <span class="No-Break">is used</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Notes</strong>: Any other relevant information (<span class="No-Break">optional field)</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Why does a business glossary matter?</h3>
			<p>A business glossary matters for any company because it serves as the common language the company uses to discuss <a id="_idIndexMarker398"/>key information. Aligning on business terms is helpful in everyday business, as it ensures everyone in the company, from the CEO down to the individual analyst, is speaking the <span class="No-Break">same language.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">At one company I worked at, we spent almost 18 months aligning on an enterprise definition for the term “customer.” Because some of our business units were business-to-business and some were business-to-consumer, the definition needed to be broad enough to cover both business models but specific enough not to include prospects or leads. Aligning the entire business included a wide range of stakeholders, some of whom were very passionate about the term. However hard the alignment was, it was critical we defined it properly so that our enterprise reporting and decision-making were consistent. We could not report information to the C-suite or the board without <span class="No-Break">this alignment.</span></p>
			<h3>How to measure progress</h3>
			<p>As you build out your business glossary capability, you will need to report on progress to your stakeholders, your manager, and<a id="_idIndexMarker399"/> perhaps the enterprise data committee. Several metrics can be used to measure and communicate the progress your team is making in terms of delivery. Here are <span class="No-Break">some examples:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>The number of business glossaries completed by system/the number <span class="No-Break">of systems</span></li>
				<li>The number of business terms uploaded to the business glossary/the number of <span class="No-Break">terms defined</span></li>
				<li>The number of business terms approved/the number of business <span class="No-Break">terms defined</span></li>
				<li>The number of applications without business glossaries/the number <span class="No-Break">of applications</span></li>
				<li>The number of business terms without an assigned owner/the number of <span class="No-Break">business terms</span></li>
				<li>The number of data domains with completed business glossaries/the number of <span class="No-Break">data domains</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>How do you measure the value?</h3>
			<p>This is one of the harder c<a id="_idIndexMarker400"/>omponents of a business glossary. Most of the value is qualitative. The lack of a business glossary is often felt enterprise-wide and all the way to the top of the organization. Let me share an example <span class="No-Break">to explain.</span></p>
			<h3>Example</h3>
			<p>I once had a CEO ask me to drive<a id="_idIndexMarker401"/> alignment for the most important terms in our company. They said, “Don’t take forever to do <span class="No-Break">it through.”</span></p>
			<p>What was the problem? Why did the CEO need us to align our <span class="No-Break">top terms?</span></p>
			<p>We were in the midst of a business transformation and changing business models. He was running into issues when talking to various GMs across the business because the individual GM’s revenue numbers were not aligning with the finance teams’ numbers. When we dug in, we found that the definition of revenue used in the GMs varied widely between the GMs but also with regard to finance. The finance team had to make several adjustments to comply with GAAP, which<a id="_idIndexMarker402"/> created a notable delta between internal reporting and external reporting. This led to many cycles of discussion at very senior levels about data differences. Imagine the cost of <span class="No-Break">these meetings.</span></p>
			<p>When we aligned the business to the common terms and calculations, the teams had far more productive meetings rooted in data that everyone <span class="No-Break">agreed to.</span></p>
			<p>Here are a few ways you can measure <span class="No-Break">the value:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Reduction of Errors</strong>: A business glossary can be used to reduce errors in reporting by pulling the definition ahead of producing a report. By aligning on the definitions upfront, you can <a id="_idIndexMarker403"/>prevent cycles of the reproduction of reports when the business and the producer of the report align on what they really want ahead of report creation vs. after the report is finalized, where the numbers don’t align with what they expected, leading <span class="No-Break">to rewrites.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Increases in Efficiency</strong>: Having a business glossary can improve efficiency by making it faster to find and use information. This can be exponentially impactful the larger the organization you <span class="No-Break">are in.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>As you might note, these are time savings. You could produce a model to measure these assumptions and validate the assumptions with the business users. For example, we believe that once we have a business glossary defined with adequate definitions and sourcing, we expect each report production time will be reduced by 20 hours due to upfront alignment vs. the back and forth experienced today. By using this assumption of 20 hours x 100 reports per year, we predict we will save 2,000 hours of labor per year (equivalent to one full-time employee). If your organization produces 1,000 reports per year (or 10,000), imagine the impact this simple solution <span class="No-Break">can make.</span></p>
			<h3>Who manages the business glossary?</h3>
			<p>The office of the Chief Data &amp; Analytics Officer is ultimately responsible for the business glossary of the company. Within the office of the CDAO, the data management solutions team, which manages all the metadata, data quality, and primary data, should drive the enterprise business glossary, as well as the tooling to support <span class="No-Break">the enablement.</span></p>
			<p>Most companies assign a leader <a id="_idIndexMarker404"/>who is focused on metadata management to drive the capabilities outlined in this chapter. In all of my previous data teams, I have had a team of anywhere from 3–15 people (sometimes more for larger companies) focused on this area. Why so big? If you are aligning on an enterprise glossary for a company with 6,000 applications, you’re going to need robust processes, forums, and tools, as well as a roadmap to deliver. The work is never “done.” As companies evolve and serve new markets, new customer bases develop and deploy new systems, all of which lead to more business glossary work for <span class="No-Break">your team.</span></p>
			<h3>What does a mature business glossary capability look like?</h3>
			<p>As you work to mature a business glossary capability for your company, there are a series of actions you can take to drive more maturity and use of a business glossary. In maturing data governance programs, business glossaries are often created for a particular system or data domain, but in more mature companies, an enterprise glossary is created to standardize business definitions<a id="_idIndexMarker405"/> across the company. An enterprise business glossary usually enables the <span class="No-Break">following capabilities:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>A synthesized and rationalized business glossary <span class="No-Break">versus duplicates/divisional</span></li>
				<li>Drives the adoption <span class="No-Break">of ontologies</span></li>
				<li>The rationalization of terminology and its association with <span class="No-Break">data assets</span></li>
				<li>Enables the linkage of business terms <span class="No-Break">across domains</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Ultimately, the enterprise-wide alignment of the complete information associated with the business terms, including meaning, relationships, and lineage, helps drive a true enterprise business glossary. In the preceding example, in which I worked with the CEO to drive a common report of the top metrics across the company, we started the enterprise business glossary with the nine terms he was interested in standardizing. From there, the team built out a standard enterprise business glossary as we continued to add more standardized terms to our metrics as a <span class="No-Break">service program.</span></p>
			<p>However, it doesn’t take a CEO request to begin this work; you should begin to synthesize and rationalize business glossaries across the company as a part of your standard program. The easiest place to start is identifying where you already have duplicates across data domains and/or systems, and you can easily determine the enterprise definition. These<a id="_idIndexMarker406"/> common definitions are your “enterprise” <span class="No-Break">business terms.</span></p>
			<p>You will find instances where an enterprise definition is agreed upon, but divisions have a definition that is a subcomponent that nests within the enterprise division uniquely for them. For example, you may have an enterprise term such as “revenue.” For a division, you may capture revenue by product line. While the enterprise revenue term is inclusive of the common definition, when the division is specifying its product line, they may call it “product A revenue,” which clarifies that it is revenue but for a <span class="No-Break">specific product.</span></p>
			<h3>How should you implement a business glossary?</h3>
			<ol>
				<li><strong class="bold">Scope</strong>: Define the scope <a id="_idIndexMarker407"/>of the business glossary. You could start with a system, a team, a data domain, a program, or the company at large. It’s important to align on what you will be delivering against. Define success upfront to ensure alignment with <span class="No-Break">your stakeholders.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Onboard the stakeholders</strong>: Define what the process will be and explain the expectations, timing needs, and what they can expect <span class="No-Break">for outcomes.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Gather any materials available</strong>: You may be pleasantly surprised to find that pieces of a business glossary or definitions of terms may exist. Sometimes, teams capture this information in a spreadsheet or a presentation for shared use. Leverage what is on hand as a <span class="No-Break">starting point.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Define the terms</strong>: Work with the business data stewards and users of the information to define the definitions, align on synonyms and antonyms, provide examples, and collect any <span class="No-Break">relevant notes.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Publish the glossary</strong>: Put the collected information to work in your enterprise <span class="No-Break">business glossary.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-144"><a id="_idTextAnchor143"/>Data catalog</h2>
			<p>This stores information about the organization’s data assets, such as data location, format, lineage, and quality. The <strong class="bold">data catalog</strong> is usually a key metadata capability for data engineers, data scientists, and other technical users. The data catalog may include other relevant information, such <a id="_idIndexMarker408"/>as links to source data, classification, or other pertinent information. The data catalog usually contains key information for each <a id="_idIndexMarker409"/>data asset, such as <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Name</strong>: The name of the <span class="No-Break">data asset</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Description</strong>: The description of the <span class="No-Break">data asset</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Location</strong>: Where the data asset can <span class="No-Break">be found</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Format</strong>: The Format of the data asset (curated data set, report, and <span class="No-Break">so on)</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Lineage</strong>: The history of the data asset (see <a href="B18846_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor170"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></span></a> for more information <span class="No-Break">about lineage)</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Quality</strong>: Information about the quality of the asset, such as accuracy, completeness, and so on (see <a href="B18846_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor189"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></span></a> for more information about <span class="No-Break">data quality)</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Tags</strong>: These can be used to organize and search for data assets and may also use a format to be driven (e.g., report, customer, vendor, and <span class="No-Break">so on)</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>I would expect a data catalog to provide business users with useful datasets that have already been created, which will speed discovery and time to insight for the company. Ideally, this capability should enable business users to augment the information in the data catalog with new information to continuously improve the <span class="No-Break">data catalog.</span></p>
			<h3>Why does it matter? What matters?</h3>
			<p>As a company grows and data <a id="_idIndexMarker410"/>becomes more critical to the company’s overall success, individuals and teams spend too much time searching for data they trust. In my experience, there is usually an inflection point: either something bad happens (a data breach, regulatory mandate, and so on), or it simply becomes too painful to continue to operate based on “historical knowledge” about the company, and scaling becomes a challenge. Data catalogs are the solution to help individuals and teams seek, find, and use data across the company by allowing individuals to reuse common <span class="No-Break">data assets.</span></p>
			<p>This problem is not new. According to an IDC white paper from 2001, “<em class="italic">A 1998 survey found that 76% of company executives considered information to be “mission critical” and their company’s most important asset. Yet, 60% felt that time constraints and a lack of understanding of how to find information were preventing their employees from finding the information they needed</em>.” Furthermore, Forbes reported that in 2018, data professionals were still spending 50% of their time finding and <span class="No-Break">governing</span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker411"/></span><span class="No-Break"> data.</span></p>
			<p>Here are some indicators that you may need a <span class="No-Break">data catalog:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Your business analysts have a hard time finding the data they need to populate their reports and/or <span class="No-Break">BI tools</span></li>
				<li>Finding information in<a id="_idIndexMarker412"/> your data lake is difficult, if <span class="No-Break">not impossible</span></li>
				<li>When data can be found, understanding it is still <span class="No-Break">a challenge</span></li>
				<li>There is no ownership for data or data assets, so finding someone to answer basic questions is near impossible or very <span class="No-Break">time consuming</span></li>
				<li>Reusing data assets from other individuals requires you to know the data asset exists and who created it so you can use <span class="No-Break">it, too</span></li>
				<li>No process exists to verify the data <span class="No-Break">is trustworthy</span></li>
				<li>The source of the data is unknown, so blind reliance is required <span class="No-Break">for use</span></li>
			</ol>
			<h3>How do you measure the value?</h3>
			<p>In my experience, most companies have not fully adopted data catalogs, which are the most simplistic way to address these very <a id="_idIndexMarker413"/>common problems. While there are many ways to calculate the value (i.e., cost of relying on incorrect data, fines for misreporting information, time, and so on), the easiest and least controversial way to calculate the value of your data catalog is an employee’s time. Simply take the cost of a data analyst’s salary, let’s assume USD 100,000 for ease of calculation, and use the metric referenced in the preceding section of 50% of their time spent searching for information. That means 50% of their compensation annually is spent searching for and governing the data <span class="No-Break">they manage:</span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">USD 100,000 * 50% = </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">USD 50,000</strong></span></p>
			<p>How many data analysts does a company employ? 10? 100? Multiply your cost per <span class="No-Break">analyst accordingly.</span></p>
			<p>How much does a data <a id="_idIndexMarker414"/>catalog service cost? Usually, this is the total cost of ownership, which includes the licensing cost, the server costs, and the management of the tooling (<span class="No-Break">metadata analysts).</span></p>
			<p>What about the factor of time lost searching vs. more <span class="No-Break">productive tasks?</span></p>
			<p>All of these answers should factor into your company’s decision to invest in an enterprise data catalog. Don’t forget to consider the opportunities lost by not having this capability. What might you be able to do if you didn’t have to deploy your analysts to search for data day after day? Could they be creating new revenue-generating ideas? The total picture of opportunity and cost is relevant to tell the real value that a data catalog can bring to <span class="No-Break">your company.</span></p>
			<h3>What metrics should be used to measure maturity?</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>The number of data <a id="_idIndexMarker415"/>assets checked into the <span class="No-Break">data catalog</span></li>
				<li>The number of data assets with <span class="No-Break">complete information</span></li>
				<li>The number of data assets certified by the data steward (meaning, validated source, data quality, and <span class="No-Break">ownership identified)</span></li>
				<li>The number of data assets with <span class="No-Break">data stewards</span></li>
				<li>The number of data assets being reused in total <span class="No-Break">data assets</span></li>
				<li>The number of data assets with <span class="No-Break">complete lineage</span></li>
				<li>The number of data assets from each data domain logged in the enterprise data catalog/the number of <span class="No-Break">data assets</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="callout-heading">Example</p>
			<p class="callout">In one of my previous roles, we had to rationalize data assets as a part of our customer data transformation. Originally, we had customer data spread across the entire company. As we deployed a unified customer data record system, we rationalized customer data assets in our enterprise data catalog. This provided the company with the approved or “authorized” definitions, assets, and location for the golden source data. Any other source of customer<a id="_idIndexMarker416"/> data was considered “non-certified,” and the CDAO did not stand behind <span class="No-Break">its reliability.</span></p>
			<h3>Who manages it?</h3>
			<p>Similar to the business glossary, you <a id="_idIndexMarker417"/>may have multiple levels of management for a data catalog. You may have divisional or data domain-driven data catalogs, which are managed by a business data steward or business <span class="No-Break">data team.</span></p>
			<p>These business data leaders will partner with your metadata leaders in the CDAO office to establish and effectively manage the enterprise data catalog. Optimally, an organization would have an enterprise data catalog exclusively, with ways to manage and tag information that is specific to a singular data domain. This transparency is ideal for data evolution, such as when a data asset previously used at a divisional level is discovered and adopted at an enterprise level. If the transparency into the divisional/data domain’s data catalog is not visible to the enterprise, the data assets cannot be <span class="No-Break">leveraged effectively.</span></p>
			<p>However, having divisional or domain-based data catalogs are a great place to start if your organization does not have a data catalog capability. You don’t need a tool to get started. You can use something as simple as a spreadsheet and mature into a tool when you are ready <span class="No-Break">to invest.</span></p>
			<h3>What does maturity look like?</h3>
			<p>The enterprise-wide alignment of the<a id="_idIndexMarker418"/> complete information associated with the data assets includes the meaning, relationships, and lineage to drive a true enterprise data catalog. A mature data catalog capability should make it very easy for a business user to determine <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>What data <span class="No-Break">you have</span></li>
				<li>Who is accountable for <span class="No-Break">the data</span></li>
				<li>Where the data is <span class="No-Break">sourced from</span></li>
				<li>Whether the data <span class="No-Break">is trustworthy</span></li>
				<li>Where to find the data (ideally, there could be a link <span class="No-Break">to it)</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The seamless and secure access to data assets enterprise-wide, including integration with identity access management to ensure the right people have the right access to the right assets at the right time, is <a id="_idIndexMarker419"/>optimal. It can be quite frustrating when a data catalog makes the data easy to find, but then a user spends days, weeks, or months waiting for <span class="No-Break">access approvals.</span></p>
			<p>Easy discoverability/sophisticated search (e.g., powered by AI) makes this capability even more interesting. Some newer features will suggest additional assets given your search history. The recommendations embedded in data catalogs are making it even easier for users to find what they need and, sometimes, additional information they didn’t know <span class="No-Break">they wanted.</span></p>
			<h3>How should you use it?</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Business users should find the <a id="_idIndexMarker420"/>data they need by <strong class="bold">searching</strong> a <span class="No-Break">data catalog</span></li>
				<li>Understand the data being used more easily and <strong class="bold">consistently</strong> with others (<span class="No-Break">common language)</span></li>
				<li>Helps business users <strong class="bold">better interpret </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">technical information</strong></span></li>
				<li>Use the data to <strong class="bold">create insights</strong> needed to answer key <span class="No-Break">business questions</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-145"><a id="_idTextAnchor144"/>Building optimal metadata management capability</h1>
			<p>In 2021, I participated in an interview <a id="_idIndexMarker421"/>where I boldly (at the time) stated that metadata was the most underappreciated data governance capability. Now, in late 2023, I stand beside that statement. It’s my firm belief that metadata is the power behind all data governance. To this day, I am asked what companies should do to maximize their investment in data governance, and every time, I suggest a strong investment in metadata capabilities by creating and optimizing a <span class="No-Break">data marketplace.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-146"><a id="_idTextAnchor145"/>What is a data marketplace?</h2>
			<p>A data marketplace is what I would call a “business of data capability,” meaning that it is driven by the data office. When powered and<a id="_idIndexMarker422"/> supported by technology, a <strong class="bold">data marketplace</strong> is a single location for a company to create a shopping-like experience for all data assets. The foundation of the data marketplace is powered by metadata and allows users to access data assets from<a id="_idIndexMarker423"/> a single platform with ease. Ease of search and discovery are critical features of a world-class <span class="No-Break">data marketplace.</span></p>
			<p>A data marketplace can solve a number of issues for a company, including, but not limited to, <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Locating data from across the organization (<span class="No-Break">1:M platforms/systems/sources)</span></li>
				<li>Identify duplicate data (proliferation of data assets) to drive <span class="No-Break">simplification efforts</span></li>
				<li>Identify data quality issues to drive <span class="No-Break">remediation efforts</span></li>
				<li>Drive the transparency of data definitions, calculations, sourcing, and the quality of <span class="No-Break">data assets</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-147"><a id="_idTextAnchor146"/>What’s in a data marketplace?</h2>
			<p>A data marketplace contains both metadata (business and technical) and data assets, providing workflow for stewardship<a id="_idIndexMarker424"/> activities, and it does all of this with unified transparency for the enterprise. You should include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Data governance policies (<span class="No-Break">links to)</span></li>
				<li>Stewardship workflows to enable proposed definitions, approvals, and <span class="No-Break">so on</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Business glossary</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Data dictionary</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Data lineage</span></li>
				<li>Data products (links, owners, and <span class="No-Break">certification status)</span></li>
				<li>Certified data assets (reports and <span class="No-Break">curated datasets)</span></li>
				<li>Standardized <span class="No-Break">enterprise KPIs</span></li>
				<li>Data quality <a id="_idIndexMarker425"/>metrics for the <span class="No-Break">above capabilities</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-148"><a id="_idTextAnchor147"/>Why does a data marketplace matter?</h2>
			<p>A data marketplace is a seamless, connected experience that provides the capabilities described in the preceding section to enable the company to find the data that it needs quickly, efficiently, and with trust<a id="_idIndexMarker426"/> and transparency by design. If time matters to your business, a data marketplace can accelerate the time to insight unlike any other capability. The best data marketplaces I have seen have focused ruthlessly on great user experiences by keeping the user interface simple, content-relevant, and focusing on quality content over quantity <span class="No-Break">of content.</span></p>
			<p>In the background, the CDAO office will likely spend time integrating a variety of features, systems, and processes to make the data marketplace a delightful experience for users. Do not hesitate to invest in this capability. The number one complaint from my stakeholders has always been around the challenge of finding trustworthy information, and a data marketplace solves this problem. If you can make it easy for your stakeholders at all levels of the organization to find the information they need to do their jobs well, you will be successful as a <span class="No-Break">data leader.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-149"><a id="_idTextAnchor148"/>Measuring outcomes and return on investment</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>The number of <a id="_idIndexMarker427"/>unique users (you could<a id="_idIndexMarker428"/> track by business unit or region for more specific intelligence) per month (or any time horizon that’s relevant to <span class="No-Break">your business).</span></li>
				<li>The number of unique data products/assets onboarded to <span class="No-Break">the marketplace.</span></li>
				<li>The number of unique certified data products/assets onboarded to <span class="No-Break">the marketplace.</span></li>
				<li>The number of <span class="No-Break">systems connected.</span></li>
				<li>Persona-based user counts. This tracks the number over a set duration (i.e., monthly or quarterly) and determines<a id="_idIndexMarker429"/> which personas are using more or less over time so you <a id="_idIndexMarker430"/>can explore why and drive additional use. Some examples include data engineers, data analysts, business analysts, and <span class="No-Break">executive management.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-150"><a id="_idTextAnchor149"/>Setting up metadata management for success</h1>
			<p>Ultimately, a great metadata program helps <a id="_idIndexMarker431"/>companies to answer fundamental data questions such as, What data do we have? How is it classified? Where is our data? Who is responsible for it? How can I find it? Can I use it? Being able to answer these fundamental questions is what makes a metadata management program successful. The CDAO and metadata management leaders, together, must share the value proposition of this capability. My advice is not to be afraid to share what can go wrong without strong metadata management but also what can go right when you have a strong metadata <span class="No-Break">management program.</span></p>
			<p>While at face value this capability may seem fairly straightforward, the implementation of a strong program across a large company takes time, focus, and clear communication about the value. I recommend starting with a data domain or a single system and working across your company to drive implementation. While you work to capture metadata, launching a data marketplace capability will enable the company to take advantage of all the hard work your team has put into building metadata management capabilities in an <span class="No-Break">easy-to-digest format.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-151"><a id="_idTextAnchor150"/>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>The remaining data governance capabilities in the subsequent chapters will build on this metadata capability. If you do not have a strong handle on your metadata, measuring data quality, building authorized provisioning points, optimizing architecture, and building authoritative sources for common datasets (i.e., customers or products) becomes a lot more difficult. Thus, it is critical to message the importance of this foundational capability early and often as you advance the maturity of data governance at <span class="No-Break">your company.</span></p>
			<p>As a result of this chapter, you should be able to adequately explain the importance of metadata management, including why it is required for all other capabilities to be successful, understand how to design a strong metadata management function, and how to define and implement the specific needs for your company’s implementation. The next chapter will discuss the topic of metadata, but it will focus on the more<a href="https://computhink.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IDC20on20The20High20Cost20Of20Not20Finding20Information.pdf"> technical aspects of <span class="No-Break">metadata management.</span></a></p>
